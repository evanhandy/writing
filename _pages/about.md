Even from before I was a teenager, I've loved to write. Something about getting the ideas in my head down onto a word document or piece of paper was immensely satisfying. Even more amazing is being able to share my ideas with others and have them see and feel the same things I am.

I've been meaning to create a website to facilitate easier sharing of my stories for a while now, but it wasn't until a final project for a JavaScript class gave me the energy to get up and make one.

On this site you'll (hopefully) find the latest scenes for all of my current/completed stories. I intend to maintain this and post new scenes as I write them. I hope you enjoy reading my work as much as I did writing it!
