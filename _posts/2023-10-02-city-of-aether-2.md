Lucas tightened the last bolt and leaned back to inspect his work, careful not to lose his balance on the ladder.

“Okay,” he called down, “try turning it on.”

The mustached man below him nodded and turned a large valve with both hands. There was a slight rumble as the pressure in the pipe system increased. With hissing and blowing, a piston started turning a driveshaft. The man then pulled a long lever, causing the collection of gears that Lucas was working on to connect with the shaft. Only a few of them spun, though.

“So far, so good,” Lucas said, “try running a program.”

The man underneath him inserted a punch card with an assortment of holes into a slot on the main terminal. He pulled down a smaller lever attached to the wood and bronze station. The cogs near Lucas whirred to life, creating almost a musical noise as they worked their magic. Lucas bit his lip. If something were to go wrong, now would be the time. After a few tense moments, however, everything continued to work smoothly. No gears ricocheted from the array and no jams occurred. Letting out a sigh of relief, he returned his wrench to his toolbelt.

Lucas slid down the ladder, and the heavyset man turned toward him.

“Well done,” the man said.

“Don’t thank me yet,” Lucas said. “Let’s see if the results make sense.”

They waited another fifteen seconds or so for the program to finish executing, and a printout emerged from the terminal. Lucas and the man both looked at the strip of paper.

“Looks good to me,” Lucas said, eyes roving the mathematical jargon.

“You can actually read that stuff?” the man asked.

“Of course,” Lucas said. “How could I understand how an analytical engine works and not recognize its results?”

The man considered Lucas. “You don’t mean to say you actually…”

Lucas shrugged. “It’s not every day I get to work on an analytical engine of this size. Thanks for the opportunity, Mr. Chester.”

“I must admit when a ten-year-old…”

“Eleven,” Lucas interjected. “I’m eleven.”

“When a young lad entered my shop,” Mr. Chester continued, “I thought you were only looking for some cheap work at the wrong place.” He shook his head. “I guess that’s what I get for underestimating the youth of our city.”

“No offense taken,” Lucas said, holding out his hand with the palm up.

Mr. Chester chuckled. “Alright, you little technophile.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a thick wallet. Opening it, he counted out a few bills and handed them to Lucas. “Here ya go, kid.”

“Thanks, mister!” Lucas said, pocketing the cash and hurrying out of the computing shop.

Lucas had finished the job quicker than he had originally anticipated, the clocktower just now announcing that it was ten o’clock in the morning. He smiled. All the more time for himself. He hustled toward the public square by the train station. He hadn’t needed to ride a train today, which saved him quite a few pennies.

Passing by the fountain in the center of the square, Lucas did a double take as he saw a young girl standing by the fountain. She was wearing the strangest clothes. Rather than the classic corset-blouse combo, she simply had on a dirty white blouse. Her skirt was odd too, it seemed to have only one layer and was a dull green color, leading to an overall plain look. He shrugged. Not that he was a fashion expert, what with his own dirty white shirt and baggy, brown pants held up by a pair of suspenders.

Turning, Lucas headed toward the street where the grocer was. Hearing familiar music, he briefly looked and saw that Mysterious Mike had set up shop in this public square for the day. He chuckled to himself. Maybe someday he would watch his show just to point out all his tricks. Hustling out of the square, Lucas ran down the stone paved street surrounded on either side by tall buildings, some stone, others wood and brick. Soon he arrived at Mr. Pinch’s grocery.

Ducking inside, Lucas walked down the aisles, picking out a loaf of bread, an apple, and two cans of soup. Going to the counter, he deposited his load and looked up at the cashier.

“Hello, Mr. Pinch!” Lucas said cheerfully.

“Hello there, Lucas,” Mr. Pinch said, ringing up his order. He was a tall, thin man with a big nose, a mustache, and a pair of large round glasses. “Is this all for today?”

“Yup!” Lucas said, reaching into his pocket for his newly earned money. Pulling out the cash, he counted out the proper amount and handed it over.

“Change in pennies again, I assume?” Mr. Pinch asked.

“You know it.”

“What are you going to do when you run the world out of pennies, young man?” Mr. Pinch chuckled, counting out several dozen copper coins, each stamped with the face of the seventh president of the city on the front and a cogwheel on the back.

“I guess people would have to make some more,” Lucas replied simply.

“That they would,” Mr. Pinch said, handing over Lucas’s change. Lucas pocketed the coins along with the rest of his cash, grabbed his groceries, and left the store, throwing a goodbye over his shoulder.

Arms full, Lucas walked down the streets of the city, slowly making his way back to his hideout. The city was always bustling, but this time of day was less crowded than during lunch hour. As he neared his destination, he took a set of stairs up and left the ground level of the city beneath him. Winding his way through staircases and terraces, he climbed higher and higher until he neared the rooftop level. There were still plenty of walkways spanning the gaps between buildings and across the streets below, but it was much more sparsely populated up here than on the ground.

Treading across a final catwalk that extended from one tall building to another, shorter building, Lucas stepped onto a narrow terrace. A door led into the main building, and a staircase ran up on top of it, which ended at another door that led to a portion of the building separate from the main structure.

Opening the plain wooden door at the top of the stairs with his foot, Lucas stepped into his small, private home. The bare walls welcomed him back as he walked across the wooden floor to his kitchen table. It was also his living room table. Setting down the bread and soup, Lucas started munching on the apple. With his other hand, he reached in his pocket for the paper money, retrieving it and placing it in the cigar box next to his red-blanketed bed.

Climbing up the ladder to the second story, Lucas fished out the pennies from his pocket. Walking over to his workbench, he placed the coins in a small iron flask and set the crucible with the coins in his miniature forge. Lucas fetched his tinderbox and some kindling and got to work lighting his forge. Soon, he had a steady fire going, and he added some coal from his supply to the flame. While the forge heated up, Lucas checked the iron boiler he had installed inside the forge. The water level was low, so he topped it off with some tap water from the waterline he had run up from the kitchen back when he had first acquired the forge.

Lucas manually worked the bellows until the boiler heated up and started producing steam. Then it was a matter of engaging the proper mechanism, and the bellows worked itself. Smoke from the forge and steam from the engine rose through his little chimney, and Lucas went downstairs to eat some soup while he waited for the copper coins to melt. Finishing his meal, he returned to his forge. Putting on his thick leather gloves and brass goggles, he grabbed his tongs and inspected the crucible. The coins were melted.

Lucas put the iron flask back in the forge and readied the gear molds he had made days earlier. Picking up the tongs again, he carefully poured the liquid metal into the molds. There was enough material for one gear, and he poured the remaining metal into an ingot mold to save for the next time he smelted copper. Satisfied, he put the crucible back in the forge and disengaged the steam engine from the bellows.

Returning to his workbench, Lucas inspected his work-in-progress. It was a steam powered, single shaft, micro analytical engine. It had been over a year since he came up with the idea, and he’d been collecting parts ever since. Eventually, he realized that he needed to make his own parts for many of the more intricate portions. After drawing dozens of sketches, he had begun making the gears, rods, and connectors piece by piece. It had been a long process, but he was nearing completion. The possibilities of a personal analytical engine filled Lucas with wonder and excitement.

While he waited for the freshly cast gear to cool, Lucas returned to the first floor of his cramped house and got in his bed. He didn’t sleep, rather he simply lay there, staring up at his ceiling as gears whirred and spun in his mind.
