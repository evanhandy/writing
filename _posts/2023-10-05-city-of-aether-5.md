Kassie sat cross-legged on her bed in her nightgown, a flowerpot filled with dirt set before her. She dropped a couple of seeds onto the dirt and closed her eyes. Feeling with her magic, she centered her attention on the seeds. Kassie cocked her head in concentration as she established a link between the seeds and her well of magic. The connection complete, Kassie opened her eyes again.

Looking at the seeds, Kassie began feeding them some of her power. She felt pressure build up along the magical line. Then, with an inaudible pop, the seeds sprouted. Maintaining the flow of power, Kassie mentally guided the seedlings. Drop roots into the soil. Reach upward with stalks. Sprout leaves. The seedlings followed her commands. Soon, a flower bloomed in front of her.

Suddenly, the door to her room opened. Kassie jolted, and the flower wilted, disintegrating into dust. She looked up. The doorway was filled with inky blackness. Emerging from the wall of darkness, Kassie’s mom entered the room. She shut the door behind her, the door blocking Kassie’s view of her father’s warding spell.

“Hey, Kassie,” Kassie’s mom said softly.

“Hi, mom,” Kassie responded.

Kassie’s mom looked at the flowerpot. “Practicing some of my plant magic?”

Kassie shifted her eyes to the side. “Just passing time.”

“You know, once the tutor comes, you’ll learn how to do so much more with your magic.”

“Yeah,” Kassie said, “except I won’t be able to leave the ward for five years.”

“But think of the knowledge you’ll gain,” Kassie’s mom encouraged, sitting down on the edge of the bed. “With you inheriting both your father’s shadow magic and my plant magic, there are all sorts of wonders that you can do.”

“Yeah, but what can I do with that?” Kassie asked. “Practice in secret, hidden away in the scattered magical wards throughout the city?”

“That’s the lot we’ve been born into. Blessed with great power but burdened with secrecy and isolation.”

“I wish it didn’t have to be that way.”

“So do I,” Kassie’s mom said. “So do I.”

“Is dad going to keep the warding spell up all night?”

“He’ll take it down in the morning.”

Kassie bit her lip and looked toward the window, the glass filled with the same shadowy substance that blocked the doorway.

Kassie’s mom glanced in the direction Kassie was looking. “I know it’s constricting,” Kassie’s mom said, “but this will pass, and you’ll be all the better girl because of it.”

Kassie nodded but didn’t say anything.

“Now, get some sleep,” Kassie’s mom said, leaning in and kissing Kassie on the top of her head.

Kassie’s mom got up and opened the door, revealing the swirling darkness beyond. With one last backward look, Kassie’s mom stepped through the doorway, and the door shut.

Kassie couldn’t hear anything through the warding spell, but she waited a few seconds anyway for her mom to get out of earshot. Since her mom wasn’t a target of the spell, the darkness would be transparent to her and not block sound. Once Kassie was confident that her movements wouldn’t draw attention, she quickly changed into her day clothes. Grabbing her pouch of seeds, she tied it to her apron string and walked over to her window. She tried to open the window, but it wouldn’t budge. As expected. She smiled. She bet her father hadn’t expected what she was about to do next.

Standing on her bed, Kassie turned out the oil lamp that hung in the center of her room. Perfect darkness enveloped her. She breathed deeply and reached outward with her magic, feeling all the places she had marked for shadow hopping. She had tried teleporting through her father’s warding spells before when she was little, but doing so had proven difficult. Even when she had succeeded, she ended up winded, and her father was magically alerted that she had left. She knew that if she passed through his shadow boundaries, he would start a search immediately. If she was anywhere in Eaglet Ward, she would be found and caught, and then things would be even worse.

So, she would shadow hop *outside* Eaglet Ward.

Pushing the limits of her extrasensory perception, her mind finally caught a hold on something. It was the mark she had made earlier that day in the alley near the train station. She breathed a sigh of relief. She had thought that maybe the light from Inspector Hoffman’s ray gun had erased her mark, but she still felt the mark there. Far away, but present.

Gathering her power and her courage, Kassie willed herself to be in the shadow she had marked in the alley that day. Instantly, she felt an opposing force. Her father’s warding spell. Now he would know she was trying to escape. She had to hurry. Gritting her teeth, Kassie poured more of her magic into her attempt, trying to overpower the containing force. She felt the resistance give a little, and she redoubled her efforts.

The forbidding power gave way, and Kassie fell to the stone ground. Her stomach clenched and a splitting pain shot through her head. She managed to get on her hands and knees before she started vomiting. Her whole body was filled with a painful vibrating sensation, like when a foot falls asleep, but across her entire form. After a good half minute of retching, she collapsed on the stones and rolled onto her back, chest heaving as she gasped for air. Her inner vessel of magical power was completely depleted. More so even, she thought as tingles continued to flash throughout her body. Was this because of the distance she had traveled? She had never shadow hopped this far in her life.

After taking a few minutes to stabilize, Kassie struggled to her feet and looked around. With her power drained, she couldn’t see perfectly in the darkness, but she still recognized this place as the alley where she had met Inspector Hoffman earlier that day. A mess of thoughts swirled in her mind. She had done it! She was out of reach of her parents. Had she really broken the law twice in one day? If she was found, she was going to be in so much trouble.

Kassie decided it would be best to move to a different location so those who would come looking for her would have a harder time finding her. Unless she wanted to be found. Did she really want to go through with this? Kassie shook her head. It was too late to turn back, she was a renegade now. Staggering a little, she left the alleyway and entered the main city streets, a girl on the run with nowhere to go.
