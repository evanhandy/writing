Kassie stirred when she heard the door open. Opening her eyes, she saw the kind woman from earlier come into the bedroom along with the boy that had been with her. Lucas, was it? Kassie struggled to sit up more in the bed.

“Don’t stress yourself,” the woman said, pulling up a chair to sit by the bed. She looked intently at Kassie and didn’t say another word.

“Who are you,” Kassie said, breaking the silence, “why are you helping me?”

“Let’s start with a little about yourself,” the woman said. “Why did you run away from home?”

Kassie looked at her hands. “I… had a disagreement with my parents.”

“What about?” the woman pressed.

“They were going to restrict my freedom, not let me leave the part of the city where I lived.”

“And why was that so bad?”

“Because…” Kassie took a deep breath. “Because then I would never be able to find my brother again.”

“So,” Lucas said in Kassie’s father’s voice, “the truth finally comes out.”

Kassie’s mouth dropped open. What was that?

“I knew one of us should have stayed in that room with her,” the woman said in Kassie’s mom’s voice.

Kassie’s eyes bulged as the forms of the kind woman and the young boy shifted into those of her parents.

“Mom?” Kassie said. “Father? How did you find me?”

“Did you really think you could escape from Eaglet Ward?” Kassie’s mom said.

“You may have sneaked past my warding spell,” Kassie’s father said, “but the fine officers of the Bureau always find their mark, isn’t that right, inspector?”

Kassie’s face paled as, like honey flowing over a pickled yam, the intimidating figure of Inspector Hoffman materialized in front of her. He seemed even taller and more foreboding than she had remembered, the green glass from his right goggle lens glowing ominously.

“Kassandra Nightshade,” Inspector Hoffman said, his voice unnaturally deep and rumbling. “You have been found guilty of defying your parents and the councilman of Eaglet Ward. Once again, you used magic outside of your ward, and it is on these grounds that I issue this verdict.”

Reaching into his sleeve, the detective pulled out a scroll of paper that unfurled in his hands, the length dropping to the ground and rolling out the bedroom door.

“Kassie,” the inspector read, “you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment inside the cab of a train.”

Even with her heart pounding, Kassie felt a ray of hope. Perhaps she would at least see her brother again.

“That’s the thing, Kassie,” Inspector Hoffman said, taking his hat and goggles off. Kassie gasped in disbelief. “I am your brother.”

“That’s not true!” Kassie yelled. “I don’t believe it, my brother wouldn’t do this to me!”

“It’s time to go,” Kassie’s brother said, grabbing her shoulder.

“No!” Kassie screamed. “I won’t let you take me to prison!”

“It’s time to wake up,” Kassie’s brother repeated, shaking her shoulder firmly.

“Don’t want to go…” Kassie panted, squinting her eyes shut.

“Hey. Hey!” a woman’s voice said. “You need to wake up, girl!”

Kassie blinked her eyes opened. Everything was blurry. Someone was leaning over her with a hand on her shoulder.

“Brother?” Kassie wheezed.

“Brother?” the woman said. “Am I that unladylike?”

Rubbing her eyes, Kassie shook her head and took another look at the figure. It wasn’t her brother. It was that kind woman, who had turned out to be her mom.

“Mom?” Kassie croaked.

“Better,” the woman said. “Try Diana.”

“Diana?”

“There we go. What’s up with you, girl? When Lucas and I got back, we found you convulsing and muttering in your sleep.” Diana put a hand on Kassie’s forehead. “Figures, you’ve got a fever.”

Sleep. Fever. Had she been dreaming? It all had felt so real. Though, thinking back on it, Kassie realized that some aspects of it didn’t make sense. Inspector Hoffman secretly being her brother? Who would think of something so weird?

“Guess I got the right medicine, seeing it’s also a fever,” Diana said, setting a brown paper bag on the bed. Reaching into the bag, she pulled out two jars. One had large white pills inside, while the other seemed to be filled with various hard candies.

“Grab me a cup of water, Lucas,” the woman said, opening the jar of pills. It was then that Kassie noticed the boy. She suspected he wasn’t her father in disguise, either.

“Yes, ma’am,” Lucas said, hurrying off into another room.

“Who are you?” Kassie said. Now that she was more awake, she was surprised at how weak and hoarse her voice sounded. “Why are you helping me?”

“Like I mentioned earlier, I’m Diana,” the woman said. “I own this building. The kid’s Lucas. As for why I’m helping you, it would be a crime if I didn’t. Though, technically, it might be a crime that I am.” Diana shrugged and fished out a pill from the bottle. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”

Lucas returned with a blue ceramic mug filled with water. Diana handed the mug and a pill to Kassie.

“Take this,” Diana said, “it should help with the fever and whatever’s bleeding inside.”

Kassie nodded. She popped the pill into her mouth and washed it down with the mug of water. The water hurt her throat, and the pill almost got stuck, but with some effort, she managed to swallow the pill. She didn’t know what was making her so sick. Before, she had assumed that she was just low on magic, but now she wondered if something terrible had happened to her body.

“Now for the good stuff,” Diana said, closing the jar of pills and opening the other jar filled with colorful sweets. She poured out a couple candies into her hand and set them on the bed next to Kassie. “Don’t eat these all at once.”

“Thank you,” Kassie said. She had often seen candy while shopping but had almost never had permission or money to get any. She popped a round, white candy with red stripes into her mouth and savored the flavor.

“Can I get one?” Lucas asked.

“Yes,” Diana said, “after you finish fixing that pipe.”

“Yes, ma’am,” Lucas moaned. He left the room, and Kassie heard a door shut.

“Now,” Diana said turning back toward Kassie, “how about you tell me a little about yourself. Let’s start with your name.”
