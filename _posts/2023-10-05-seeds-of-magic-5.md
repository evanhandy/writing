“Now that’s a tree!” Asher’s father said.

Asher gaped as they emerged from the wintry forest. It was lightly snowing, but the view was still clear enough to take his breath away. Before them lay an expansive, open valley. A swath of snowy farmlands circled around one side of a sprawling city. Over a dozen airships drifted above it, sails taut against magical winds. Many large trees could be seen spread throughout the city, but above it all loomed the Mother Tree. Well outside the city boundaries, it was so tall that it extended up and above the heavy cloud cover. However, the immediate area around the trunk was free of clouds, as if the tree had punched a hole in the sky.

Attached to the tree, circling up the trunk on both sides, were large, circular platforms supported by branches. On each platform, an entire landscape was contained. The biomes of each platform were wildly different, one was a mix of green hills and gray mountains, another a desert with towering dunes, and yet another was a volcanic wasteland.

“Look at the Elemental Basins!” Asher said.

“That can’t be real lava, can it?”

“According to my books it is.”

“It’s dripping off the sides of the basin, does it just fall to the ground?”

“I’m not sure,” Asher said. “I don’t see any fires on the ground beneath it. It’s almost as if it just disappears before landing.”

“I don’t like it. I hope you come back home long before the Trials reach that basin.”

“The trials in each basin are supposed to take a month to complete, so I should be good, assuming that basin is on the downward descent.”

“How many basins do they plan on putting you kids through? I count five that I can see.”

“There should be two more on the back side of the trunk and one underground for a total of eight, four going up on the right and four coming down on the left. The books say that the applicants who make it all the way through the Trials also spend two months on the ground and two in the tree’s canopy.”

“So, it really is a year of trials,” Asher’s father breathed. “But take a look at the cloud cover, it clears up around the tree.”

“It’s as if the clouds are avoiding it,” Asher agreed.

“And yet we still can’t see the top,” his father said, sounding disappointed. “Even I’ve heard stories about how the tree’s leaves shine like millions of stars. Hopefully the weather will clear before I have to head back home.”

“That must be the capital.” Asher said, pointing towards the city. “Look at all the mage trees!”

“I believe you’re right about that being the capital,” his father said, checking their map. “It’s the only city in the vicinity of the Mother Tree. This is my first time seeing the big city too. All those airships as well, it’s quite the spectacle. We’ll pass it by, but we don’t have time to really enjoy it. The gates to the Mother Tree open tonight, and it’s already in the afternoon. Besides, we don’t have money to spend on overpriced food and souvenirs.”

They continued on the busy road down into the valley. Over the past three days they had encountered more and more travelers, and now they were hardly ever on the road alone. The travelers were mainly youths accompanied by one or two adults, most likely other applicants headed to the Mother Tree with their parents for the Ascension Trials. Sometimes they passed whole families traveling together. The stream of people, horses, oxen, and wagons flowed down the road, brushing up against and bleeding into the capital before ending in a massive fairground near the wall that surrounded the tree and much of the ground around it. Hundreds of tents were set up, and even more campfires smoked, their thin trails fading into the crisp winter air.

“When exactly do the gates open?” Asher asked.

“You probably know more than I do,” his father said. “If I had to guess, I’d say they’d open at midnight just for dramatic effect.”

They rolled past the various entry points into the capital and filed into the fairgrounds. It took them a while to find a clear spot amid the crowd, but eventually they found an unoccupied patch of snow and settled down.

Asher’s father unhitched their horse and gave it a moderate leash. It immediately began to roam around, nibbling at tufts of grass that poked out of the snow here and there. Asher’s father went to the wagon and pulled out some firewood they had brought from home and began making a campfire, saving two logs to use as seats. Using a sliver of mage wood to start the fire, Asher’s father sat down and warmed his hands by the flame. They spent the next few hours in companionable silence, listening to the sounds of the crowd around them and watching the sky darken into night. The capital remained bright, and a red glow could be seen from the volcanic basin on the Mother Tree. Far above, the clouds began to clear, revealing the outstretched upper branches of the Mother Tree, whose bright leaves cast a twinkling shine on the fairgrounds bright enough for Asher to read by.

“It’s crazy, you know,” Asher’s father said. “Sending you kids off like this for so long when you’re so young.”

“We’ll have mages watching over our training and trials. We’ll have our needs taken care of.”

“I know, it’s just that… It’s hard for a parent to send off a child, even if it is just for a little while. I thought I’d be saying goodbye to Bud first. Never thought I’d be seeing you off before him. Didn’t really have time to prepare for it, emotionally, I mean.”

“Yeah, me neither.”

“I love you son, I hope you know that.”

“I do,” Asher said, rubbing his nose. “I love you too, father.”

“You’re doing our whole family a great service. I’m astonished and grateful for your bravery, willing to go out on your own.”

“To be honest, it still doesn’t seem real to me. Even though I’m here. Even though I’m sitting beneath the Mother Tree.”

The conversation lulled for a while, then Asher’s father spoke again.

“Listen,” he said. “Remember when you asked me at the mage’s funeral why we’re not tree keepers?”

“Yeah.”

Asher’s father took a deep breath. “Your great-grandmother was a Lee,” he said.

“Wait, Lee as in Keeper Lee, the head tree keeper?”

Asher’s father nodded. “She was his sister.”

“Was she a tree keeper too?”

“She was, when she was young. Once she and her brother were adults, however, the family right of being tree keepers stayed in his line, and not hers.”

“But why?”

“It happens from time to time. If all of a keeper’s children and their families became keepers, there would be a lot more keepers, more than necessary. Sometimes a child of a tree keeper is ‘set loose,’ so to speak. Released from the calling of tree keeper to pursue their own path.”

“That doesn’t sound too bad.”

“It’s still painful, though,” Asher’s father said, stirring the fire. “She was essentially disowned from her family traditions, with nothing to show for it except a handful of talismans.”

“Is that where we got our fire talismans from?”

“Aye, some of them, passed down through the generations. I only use them when I need to, to prolong their life. I imagine when I’m old I’ll divide them between you and Bud like my father divided them between me and my siblings. Of course, you could buy new ones from the yearly trimmings, those old talismans aren’t holding their charge like they used to.”

“I think I would keep them,” Asher said after a moment of thought, “even if just for mementos.”

Asher’s father smiled. “I think she would be happy to hear that.”
