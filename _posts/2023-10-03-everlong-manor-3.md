Walking down the lush carpet, Trevor forced himself to not run. The wide halls were still familiar at this point, and it was tempting to dash through them like he did when he was doing normal errands. But this was no normal errand. He patted his messenger bag, confirming that the package was still inside. He had buckled his bag closed, which he had never done before, to prevent against the package falling out or being stolen. Even so, he checked regularly to help settle his nerves.

Guests and staff Trevor passed either didn’t notice him or stepped out of his way once they saw his badge. Trevor looked down at the ornate circle pinned to his shirt. It had a design of an envelope on it and was red with gold detailing and edging. He chuckled, remembering the exchange he had with Missus Honeypot just fifteen minutes earlier. When she saw the parcel with ‘personal delivery’ stamped on it, she had gotten rather flustered. She mumbled something about losing an able messenger boy before handing him the badge without ceremony.

Trevor adjusted his red and black messenger cap and continued walking through the wing. Going at a slower pace helped him appreciate the complexity of his surroundings more. The fine wood and plaster of the walls, accented by intricate masonry and illuminated by sconces in the smaller halls and chandeliers in the larger ones. The floors were mostly dark, elegantly embroidered red carpet, except for the ballrooms where they were marble.

What gave life to the manor, though, were the inhabitants. The guests in their fine suits and dresses, the staff in their crisp uniforms, even the odd plumber sticking out like a sore thumb in their blue coveralls as they slunk near the walls, headed to their next unknown destination. Occasionally, he’d see a host, individuals whose faces everyone knew. Always mingling with the guests, giving speeches at the commencements of the nightly parties, or muttering to the heads of staff in low voices.

Even if he didn’t already know what they looked like, Trevor could tell the difference between a guest and a host. They had an aura of purpose and meaning about them that was so different from the light-mindedness of the guests, as if each individual host made a difference in the day-to-day life in the manor. Much different than the staff, who collectively kept the manor running, but individually were perceived as almost meaningless.

Trevor walked and walked down the long halls of the manor, crossing large ballrooms and traversing wide hallways. He kept to the main routes like Lloyd had suggested, even though Trevor knew many shortcuts in the Victoria Wing. As he passed a clock, he checked the time. Nine-thirty in the evening. He was nearing the border of the Victoria and Winston wings. Butterflies flew in his stomach as he turned into a hallway and saw the open double doors in the distance that signified the divide between the two wings. Taking a deep breath and double checking his bag, Trevor pressed onward.

As Trevor approached the doors, he was stopped by one of the two large doormen.

“Whoa, there, messenger boy,” the muscular man in a red and black uniform said. “Are you new around here? This is the end of the Victoria wing. If you have an outgoing letter, the drop-off box is in the staff hall to the left.”

Trevor pointed to his new badge. “I’m on a personal delivery mission.”

The man nodded. “I see your badge, but aren’t you rather young to be doing an inter-wing delivery?”

Trevor stood up straight. “If you have your doubts, you can check with Mr. Victoria.”

“As if I would leave my post,” the brawny man snorted. “What, should I have you carry a message to him from me? Let me at least see this letter you’re delivering.”

Trevor bit his lip, then unbuckled his bag and pulled out the package. He held it up for the man to see.

The man squinted. “I don’t see a name on this.”

“Come on, Cliff,” the other doorman said. “Let him through. He’s wearing the badge, isn’t he?”

Cliff folded his arms. “I don’t like it.”

“We’re not here to make the rules,” the other doorman said. “He has the badge, let him pass.”

Cliff sighed and his expression softened. “Alright, you’re free to go, messenger boy. Just make sure you find a good place to lie your head tonight.”

Trevor nodded. “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” With that, he scurried past the doormen and into the Winston Wing.
