Axil stood on the tree branch hundreds of feet in the air, surveying the landscape. The view from this height was impressive, but he wanted more. Scurrying to the trunk, he swung his grappling hook over the next branch. Climbing through the upper boughs of the Great Tree, he soon found himself pressing through the last of the foliage between himself and the open sky.

The sudden change in brightness as Axil broke through the canopy caused him to shade his eyes with his wooden hands. After his eyes adjusted, Axil gasped. The whole world lay before him, leafy treetops extending for miles in every direction. Overhead, the blue sky was mostly clear, only a few puffy clouds slowly drifting in the breeze that ruffled Axil’s green leaves. The brilliant sun shone down on him, and he spread his arms, soaking in as much sunlight as he could.

Axil had done it! He had climbed to the top of the world. Putting his hands on his hips, he surveyed the landscape again. Everything was within his view. He frowned. There really wasn’t much to view up here, was there? He shook his head. He was on the very top, he had climbed the tallest tree in the forest.

Then Axil saw something in the far distant west. What was that? He squinted. Could it be? His eyes widened. A mountain. He had forgotten all about mountains. If the legends were true, mountains towered high above any forest. He slapped a hand against his bark forehead. Of course it would be too easy to just climb up the Great Tree to reach the highest height. He had to go higher. He needed to climb those mountains.

Without taking another look around, Axil jumped back into the canopy. As soon as he had a straight shot to the ground, he leaped from the branches and free-fell all the way down, the leaves across his body ensuring he didn’t fall fast enough to take damage. It took a good ten seconds or so before he landed gracefully on the leafy forest floor, by far his greatest leap yet. Another addition to his growing list of accomplishments. Nodding to some of his fellow leshies he surprised with his sudden appearance, he sprinted off towards Wort’s hovel to tell him the news.

“Well, Axil,” a deep voice said behind him with some joviality, “did you reach the highest height of all creation?”

Axil skidded to a stop and turned and faced the Great Tree who smiled down at him. “No,” Axil said. “That is to say, I reached the top of your glorious branches, but I discovered that there were greater heights yet to be conquered.”

“Ah, you saw the mountains, didn’t you? Easy to forget about those when you’re deep within the wood.”

“You knew about them?” Axil exclaimed. “Why didn’t you tell me before I climbed all the way up there?”

A rumbling chuckle emanated from the ancient tree. “You seemed so determined to ascend my branches, that I hadn’t the heart to tell you. What was it you said? ‘Oh Great Tree, let me climb your mighty boughs that I may stand at the top of all that is tall?” He chuckled again.

Axil’s head leaves rustled in embarrassment. “I suppose I was rather set on the task.”

“And now you wish to hike up a mountain?”

Axil nodded. “I must go higher.”

“You do know what you’re asking, right? Not many leshies leave my forest, though that is more because they don’t want to than me stopping them.”

Axil brought his small frame to its full height, puffing out his chest. “I’m not scared of anything. I’ll go and come back again, having climbed the tallest mountain out there.”

“I’m sure you are willing,” the Great Tree said. “However, while I won’t stop you, there are others who would.”

Axil frowned. “You mean Frumple, don’t you?”

“I do. Go on, tell your friend, Wort, about your plans. I’m sure Frumple will make the effort to talk to you before you have enough time to leave.”

Axil nodded. He had stopped being surprised long ago by the Great Tree seeming to know all of his plans before he told him. Giving the Great Tree a final salute, Axil turned and scampered off. Green light filtered down through the trees on Axil as he hurried past the various dwellings nestled against the trunks of the trees. Leshies of all shapes and colors wandered the forest floor, some with gourds for heads, others with vines for hair and limbs, while others still bore leaves like Axil did.

Finally, Axil came to Wort’s abode. Knocking on the door, Axil opened it before his friend could say, ‘come in.’ Wort was at his desk, his stout mushroom body threatening to bust the backless chair he sat on.

“Wort!” Axil said. “I’m going to the mountains.”

The fungus leshy turned his face towards Axil as best he could. “The mountains?” Wort said in his ponderous voice.

“Yes, the mountains. Giant rocks that pierce the heavens. If I can climb those, truly I’ll be on the top of the world!”

“You’re leaving the forest?” Wort asked, turning his body more fully towards Axil.

Axil nodded. “This place is too small for me, I need bigger and better venues if I am to explore the greatest heights.”

Wort reached for his staff that rested next to him and hopped off his stool. “Then I am coming with you.”

Axil grinned. “I was hoping you’d say that, old friend. Will you be ready to leave at morning’s light?”

Wort’s white-spotted red head cap bobbed. “I will.”

“Excellent! I knew I could count on you.”

“Count on him for what?”

Axil turned to face the newcomer who had spoken. It was Frumple, a much thinner fungus leshy and the final challenge that lay between Axil and his journey. Axil frowned, squinting at the leshy warrior.

“I am going on an adventure,” Axil stated.

“No, you’re not,” Frumple countered.

“Yes, I am.”

“No, you’re not.”

“Just try and stop me.”

“Very well,” Frumple said, “I challenge you to a duel. You and me. We fight at sundown in the Faerie Ring.”

Axil blinked. A challenge. He couldn’t just sneak away now.

“I accept your challenge,” Axil declared, placing a hand on his leafy chest, “as I, Axil, am meant to climb…”

“That’s enough of that hogwash,” Frumple interrupted. “I’ll see you in five hours.” He turned to leave.

“I’m going too,” Wort chimed in.

“Oh?” Frumple said, looking back. “You? On an adventure?”

Wort bobbed his head, or at least the upper portion of his body.

“Very well,” Frumple said, “then you shall fight me as well alongside Axil.” With that, the veteran leshy left.

There was a moment of quiet. “You’ll really fight with me?” Axil asked.

“I meant what I said,” Wort said, hopping back onto his stool and leaning over a large tome. “If I am to follow you to the top of the mountains, it wouldn’t make sense to not follow you into battle.”

Axil beamed. “Wort, you’re the best.”

“Better get your armor,” Wort counseled, turning a page. “I’ll do my best to prepare here.”

“Right,” Axil said. “See you at sundown.”
