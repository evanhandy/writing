Asher stood in front of the large cauldron, casting gloves on and fire talisman tucked away into the glove on his right hand.

“When we saw it was water boiling,” Jasper said, “I got really hopeful there for a second.”

“I mean,” Ray said, looking at his own massive pot, “it’s still boiling water.”

“Yeah,” Jasper said, “but they decided to freeze the water between tests. We couldn’t see that from the line.”

“It’s the s-s-same principle, though,” Grover pointed out. “It just might take a little longer.”

“You may begin whenever you are ready,” a nearby mage said, “though preferably sooner rather than later.”

Asher gulped and held out his right hand towards his iron cauldron. When selecting his talisman, he had run into a couple of talkative talismans, going on about how they heat things. He had made sure to steer clear of those. The talisman in his glove subtly put images of warming pots in his mind, and he decided he could live with that. Remembering his embarrassing moment back home, he let only a small portion of the power in the talisman out, focusing on heating the bottom area of the pot. There was no visible change, but Asher could feel the power leaving the talisman, and he knew it must be doing something.

After a minute passed, Gale let out a whoop.

“My ice is melting!” He cheered.

Asher checked his own ice. Still nothing.

Then that other boy showed up.

“What’s up, guys?” He said cheerfully.

Asher turned to look at him. The boy who had blown through the earth trial was slipping a fire talisman into his right glove. He had shaggy light brown hair that looked like he woke up with it that way, yet it still seemed perfectly styled. Asher didn’t know why, but that annoyed him a little bit. Taking his place at one of the twenty or so cauldrons, the boy looked at the ice inside.

“So, I just need to make this boil?” He checked.

“That is correct,” a mage confirmed.

“Great! You may want to stand back a little bit, I tend to go all out with fire.”

The mage took a step back.

The boy waved his hand towards the cauldron and a flame about the size of a campfire sprung to life underneath it.

Jasper snorted. “That’s really not that impressi—“

Suddenly, the boy turned his hand so the palm was facing up and made a long, upward gesture in front of him. The fire beneath the cauldron exploded into a massive pillar of fire, completely engulfing the pot and shooting upwards at least fifteen feet. The noise was deafening and the heat almost unbearable, even though Asher was a good twenty feet away. The vertical inferno lasted about ten seconds before vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The nearby mage stepped forward to inspect the cauldron.

“Well, there’s still some water left,” he said with a smile. “Let me mark your card and then you can go on to the next trial.”

The boy handed over his card. “The name’s Skyler Fairwind, remember that when I become one of this year’s mages.”

The mage chuckled, sitting down at one of the nearby portable desks and writing on the card. “Noted. We’ll be expecting great things from you, Skyler.”

Skyler retrieved his card and saluted before heading towards the line for the next trial, leaving Asher and the others awestruck and slightly singed. Jasper stood with his mouth open mid-word, unable to speak.

“Come on guys,” Ray said, breaking the silence, “we can’t let him leave us in the dust like that. Let’s pick up the pace.” A small fire appeared under Ray’s pot.

Asher nodded and slowly began increasing the flow of power from the talisman. He felt like he was giving it about a third of what he had when a fire appeared underneath the cauldron. Asher blinked. Could he do more? He continued upping the power flow and the fire grew. Soon the pot was engulfed in flames, yet Asher still felt like he was only at half of the talisman’s power. What did full power look like? His gut twisted. Best not to find out. He reduced the power back to a third and waited for the water to boil.
