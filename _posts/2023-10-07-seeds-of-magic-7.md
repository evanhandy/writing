Asher shuffled along with the other boys and girls towards a wide gathering area directly in front of the gates. Along the way, he saw several families still saying their goodbyes. Some groups were small, just a child and a parent. Others were larger, with other family members and friends bidding their farewells. Some of the kids looked nervous. Some were crying. Others seemed excited. As he got closer to the gates, Asher could see that the second gathering area had been flagged off from the larger fairgrounds by what looked to be a temporary fence. People in mage robes were gesturing where the children should go. Asher had never seen a mage before, but he had read enough to recognize their outfits. And here they were, directing traffic.

The ground was free of snow, perhaps cleared by the mages. When the group Asher was in eventually stopped, he and many of the others sat down. The field was sloped towards the gates like a giant theater, and he had a clear view of the entrance in the wall. From his spot’s relative height, he could see a lot past the wall too. A massive complex of buildings sat on the other side, and Asher wondered if that was where they would be staying for the next month.

His eyes were drawn towards the Elemental Basins, dimly lit by the Mother Tree’s leaves. Just how big were they? From his current position, he could only see into the lowest basins. Those mountains couldn’t be full scale. The books he read had conflicting tales about the exact size of the basins. Some said they were a day’s journey across, while others said that you could walk from one end to the other in five minutes. From what he could see, the lower basins seemed to be larger than the higher ones, but of course it could just look that way due to the difference in distance.

The next hour passed uneasily for Asher. He tried reading, but he couldn’t get his mind to focus on the words. He kept thinking about what lay ahead of him. Could he really make it through the first month of the Trials? He looked around at the impressive collection of applicants. There had to be at least several thousand of them. According to his books, more than half of them would be gone before the end of the first month. What stopped him from being one of them? He had little to no experience with talismans and wasn’t particularly strong or fast. The exact nature of the trials changed a little each year, so he had no idea what to expect. It could be lots of field testing or mainly indoor coursework. While he quietly hoped for the latter, he had a feeling that wouldn’t be the case.

Finally, Asher saw a small wooden platform levitate above the gates. Two people stood on the platform, one was a boy with blond hair that looked to be about his age, while the other was an overweight man. Both were wearing mage robes. The walled platform rose until it was a good fifty feet off the ground, about twice the height of the walls, where it hovered in place.

“Welcome, applicants!” The man said, speaking into a small object. It was the same booming voice as before, except it wasn’t so deafeningly loud. However, the amplified words were still powerful enough that Asher could feel them in his chest. He gazed at the floating platform in wonder.

“Before we open the gates,” the man continued, “I will discuss the terms of the Ascension Trials. Then we will hear from our top graduate from last year.”

Asher had read the details of the agreements many times, and he mentally ticked off each point as the announcer stated them. Only eleven-year-olds can apply. Application is free. Food and clothing will be provided. All parts of the Trials are voluntary, applicants may withdraw at any point. Throughout the Trials, applicants will be eliminated as the proctors see fit. As applicants quit or are eliminated, safe transportation to their respective hometowns will be provided.

And then there was the one that Asher was listening for.

“To compensate the families of the participants for the absence of an able child,” the announcer said, “each family of all active participants will receive reasonable compensation at the end of each month.” Asher hoped that ‘reasonable compensation’ would be enough to get his family through the winter.

The announcer continued. “And finally, each applicant that reaches the end of the Trials will be given the unparalleled opportunity to bond with a seed and become a mage, with all the associated rights, privileges, and responsibilities.”

Excited murmurs swept over the crowd. Asher folded his arms. Like there was any chance that he would get that far, or even want to be a mage in the first place. Too much responsibility, too much pressure. He’d much rather prefer to stay at home, reading books. He was only doing this to help his family.

“I want to be able to throw fireballs,” one boy near Asher said.

“I want to make houses out of ice!” A girl exclaimed.

“I want to go to bed,” another boy yawned.

The announcer motioned with his hands for the crowd to quiet down. “And now,” he said, “a word from the top of last year’s graduating applicants, Blake Stormwood.”

The man handed the small object he was talking into over to the boy and stepped back. The boy moved to the front of the platform and looked over the multitude for a few moments before speaking.

“Dear fellow youths of our fair nation,” he began, his voice magnified. “I’m honored to be able to speak to you on this momentous night. I want to commend you all for making the choice to attempt the Ascension Trials. This is not an easy task, most of you will not reach even the canopy of the Mother Tree. But know that despite the difficulty of the challenge, if you try with your might, you will succeed. That success may look different than others’, it may even be simply getting through the first day. But make that day something you’ll look back on with pride. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! Make the most that you can out of it. The knowledge and experience you can gain here surpasses any apprenticeship, any training, any book learning. Even if you don’t become a mage, you can become a better person.”

Blake stepped back and handed the speaking instrument to the announcer. Everyone applauded and cheered, and Asher found himself clapping along with them. He didn’t agree with everything Blake had said in his short speech, but he was so eloquent that it was hard not to be carried away in the moment. How does a twelve-year-old get to be such a good public speaker, anyway? He held himself with such confidence, it almost made Asher jealous of his ability.

The announcer stepped forward again. “Such inspiring words. I would hope that you all follow the example he has left for you. For your information, Blake is one of twelve that graduated this past year out of over two-thousand applicants.”

A collective gasp rippled across the crowd. Asher nodded. That added up right, according to the records of previous Ascension Trials. Still, being face-to-face with the facts was a bit intimidating.

“Now, the time has arrived. Let the three-hundred and eighty-first Ascension Trials begin!”

With those final words, the announcer gestured widely, and a group of mages on the gates raised their arms. Torrents of flame shot out from their hands, brilliantly illuminating the night sky. The mages that had served to direct the flow of traffic swirled their hands, and water appeared above the applicants. The water turned into strands of ice, a complex lattice that spanned all the way to the gate. The torrents of flame stopped, and the mages on the wall began to point at the sky, sending out thin streams of fire that exploded into bursts of sound and color. The light from the fireworks filtered through the ice structure, creating a kaleidoscope effect that sparkled dazzlingly.

The gates to the Mother Tree rumbled and slowly swung inward, and another group of mages came out and began guiding the youths inside. The line moved slowly, so Asher sat back and enjoyed the scene above. The leaves of the Mother Tree also shone through the ice framework, adding to the intricate illumination. Eventually, Asher’s row got up and moved towards the gates. As he neared the gates, he could hear the mages instructing the applicants to have their birth certificates ready. Asher fished his out of his satchel and held it in his hand. Upon reaching the gate, a mage in a booth asked for his certificate. He handed it over. After briefly scanning it, the mage waved him on.

Inside the walls, Asher found himself in a spacious cobblestone courtyard with large, four-storied, wood and stone buildings on each side. A mage directed boys to the right and girls to the left. Another mage at the door of the building handed Asher a card with a room number on it. It read ‘3304B.’ The interior of the building was lit by a network of glowing talismans. Asher assumed that they were connected by mage wood fibers and that some unfortunate mage somewhere was keeping the talismans active.

After climbing two flights of stairs and checking a number of placards, Asher found his room. There were three bunk beds in the small enclosure, along with two dressers with three drawers each. There was another boy already in the room, setting a small bag on a bed. More boys pressed in after Asher. Checking the bunks, Asher found one labeled ‘B,’ and climbed into it. It was a top bunk, and it was directly underneath one of the glowing talismans. Setting his satchel by his pillow, Asher crawled into his bedsheets. It had been a long day, and even with the talismans shining he found himself drifting off. Asher knew the morning had a lot of challenges to go along with it, but for now he let his mind relax. Soon the talismans stopped giving off light, and Asher fell asleep.
