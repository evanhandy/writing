“That was some stunt you pulled,” Jasper said, his arms folded.

Asher and Grover had waited until the others finished the trial before joining the line of youths headed for the next trial.

“It was an accident!” Asher insisted.

“Yet you told Grover to hold your pebbles before you shielded yourself using that earthen hand.”

“I wasn’t talking to Grover,” Asher muttered.

“Then who were you talking to?”

“H-he was talking to his t-t-talisman,” Grover explained.

Nobody said anything after that for a while.

“So, you talk to wood?” Jasper asked.

“Hey, it spoke to me first,” Asher retorted.

Another pause.

“I didn’t know wood could talk,” Gale commented.

“Yeah,” Asher said, “me neither.”

“What was it saying?” Ray asked.

“It kept repeating that it could hold things, it didn’t seem very intelligent.”

Jasper harrumphed. “I think this is all pretty ridiculous.”

“Look,” Graff said, pointing back towards the picketed lanes of the earth trial.

Asher and the others turned to look. There, in one of the central lanes, was a boy wearing baggy blue trousers with a leather vest over a white long-sleeved shirt that hung slightly open in the chest. But the main thing that caught Asher’s attention was the fact that this boy was practically skipping down the lane. He was also throwing his ball of stones into the air and catching it again, all without dropping a single pebble.

“How is he doing that?” Gale exclaimed. The boy was already past the halfway point.

“Focus,” Graff guessed.

“But he looks so carefree,” Ray marveled. “That must take an immense amount of skill.”

The mysterious boy quickly reached the end of his lane, showed the mage there his perfectly intact payload, and then dropped the pebbles in the depositing pile.

“Did any of you g-g-guys get all your rocks across?” Grover asked.

“I did,” Graff stated. “It was hard.”

“I couldn’t keep my focus up for the whole time,” Ray said. “The rocks started slipping out at around the halfway mark.”

“I only had a few left,” Gale admitted. “It was so difficult keeping my arm out that whole time, I thought it was going to fall off.”

“That’s why you use the strengthening properties of the earth talisman,” Jasper said with a smirk. “Once you figure that out, the rest is easy.”

“Wait, that’s a thing?” Gale exclaimed.

“Yeah,” Ray said, “but I didn’t dare split my attention between holding the rocks and fortifying myself. I was having a hard enough time keeping the talisman activated.”

“Waste of talisman charge,” Graff grunted. “Should rely on own strength.”

“Easy for you to say,” Gale muttered, rubbing his skinny arm.

Asher noticed that the boy who cleared the trial so quickly was only about ten places behind them. Most likely Asher would see him in action again in the next trial.

The line to the next trial stretched all the way back down the length of the earth trial lanes and to the front of an adjacent section of the field. It was hard for Asher to see what was going on in the trial, so there wasn’t much to do but wait.

“Such a long line,” Gale moaned as the line inched forward.

“Wait,” Ray said, fishing inside his pockets, “I’ve got this.”

He pulled out a deck of playing cards.

“Nice!” Gale approved.

“Really? Cards?” Jasper snorted. “You bring those to an event so important, it might as well be sacred?”

“Oh, h-h-hush,” Grover said, sitting on the ground as Ray got down and began shuffling the cards. Asher, Gale, and Graff all joined in, and eventually so did Jasper. They sat on the ground playing various games, scooting forward as the line moved. Asher kept an eye on the next field as he played, hoping to get a good look at what trial was next.

About three quarters of an hour later, the boys’ group had moved enough so that Asher could start to see what was going on.

“Hold up, guys,” Asher said, standing. “I want to see what the next trial is all about.”

“Aw, come on,” Gale said, “I was just about to win that round.”

“We can play again between the next two trials,” Ray said, gathering up the cards. “We really should focus on what’s next.”

“How many trials are there again?” Gale asked.

“Well,” Asher said, pulling out one of his books from his satchel, “it says here that most years of the Ascension Trials start with a general competency exam on all four of the basic elements, so I imagine we have three left to do.”

Grover looked at Asher’s satchel. “You carry your b-b-books with you everywhere?”

Asher blushed. “No, I just didn’t have enough time to really settle in before we left for breakfast, and I wanted to take my notebook with me.”

“What does your book say about these trials?” Graff asked.

“Like I said before,” Asher said, flipping through the book’s pages, “the specifics are different each year, and I have an outdated book. For example, the earth trial on the first day of the Ascension Trials back then was commonly a plowing exercise.”

“Well, I’m glad we didn’t have to do that,” Jasper huffed, “that’s peasant work.”

“What were the other trials?” Graff pressed.

“There was a water boiling exercise for fire,” Asher recited, “a bucket filling test for water, and a long jump trial for air.”

“Oh, wow,” Gale said, “those all seem very easy.”

“I g-g-guess that’s not too bad,” Grover agreed.

“I mean,” Asher said, putting his book away, “they’re not trying to kick us all out on the first day. Scaling up the trials to their modern size, history says about a hundred of the applicants will either dropout or be disqualified on the first day.” Asher prayed he wouldn’t be one of those.

“Out of over two thousand?” Ray said. “I like those odds. I bet we can all make it through this first day, what do you all say?”

Everyone enthusiastically gave their affirmation. Hope started to swell in Asher’s chest. He might just make it through this. Of course, he’d have to make it through thirty more days to make it through to the end of the month.

“I know we j-j-just met,” Grover said, “but I sure am glad that I d-don’t have to go through the Trials alone.”

Ray nodded. “Who knows, someone in our group might just complete the Trials and become a mage.”

Not me, Asher thought.

“I will.” Graff stated.

“Such confidence,” Ray said. “I’m going to try my best too.”

“Can we please just look at the next trial?” Jasper droned.

“Good idea. This first day might not be hard, but we should stay on our toes regardless.”

Asher nodded and turned his attention to the field area at the end of the line. What would they have to do next?
