“Pencils down,” Ms. Wyndham ordered. Sighs and moans fluttered throughout the classroom. Asher set his writing utensil on his desk. Checking the clock, he saw that fifty minutes had passed, though he had finished the test a good twenty minutes earlier and was just going over his answers a second time. He was confident in his performance. In fact, he thought the whole thing was rather rudimentary.

“There will be a ten minute break before we begin our next test,” Ms. Wyndham announced.

There were more sounds of complaint from the applicants. One stood up.

“That’s it,” the boy said, dressed in a red-brown tunic and almost as thickly built as Graff. “I didn’t come here for a bunch of coursework. If I wanted to stay in school, I would have just stayed home. Even then it wasn’t as much as this.”

All the other applicants turned and looked at the boy. Ms. Wyndham cocked an eyebrow. “You say this after a single fifty minute long test?”

“Yeah,” the angry boy said, “that’s way longer than anything back home. Is this what it’s going to be like the whole time?”

“Tests and coursework will constitute almost half of your daily activities here in the ascension trials,” Ms. Wyndham said simply.

Murmurs erupted between the applicants. Asher noticed that Graff was looking down intently at his desk. The brawny boy made no objections or complaints. What was going through his mind?

“Did you also find the practical exams not enjoyable?” Ms. Wyndham asked.

“They were simple, boring exercises,” the standing boy complained. “I had expected to do a lot more cool stuff here at the Ascension Trials.”

Ms. Wyndham nodded. “Very well. You may leave.”

“Wait, really?” the boy asked. “Just like that?”

“You’ll find a few mages in the central plaza where you can register with one of several groups of youths leaving for their homes tomorrow morning. Sign up for one of them and don’t be late.”

“Alright then,” the boy chuckled, “you losers have fun staying in school.”

With that, the boy sauntered out of the room. Ms. Wyndham looked at the remaining applicants. “Anyone else care to throw this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity away?”

The room was deathly silent.

Ms. Wyndham nodded again and pulled another stack of booklets out of her desk. “Then let us move on to the next test.”
