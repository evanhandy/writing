The fire of faith,

Within me it burns.

The gear of truth,

Within me it turns.

Through battle and blood,

Through ice, sand, or mud,

My faith will not grow cold,

Nor my truth turn old.

I am—


“Brother Kaephis!” a stern voice said, bringing me out of my thoughts. “We’re arriving soon, are you ready?”

I looked towards the speaker sitting across from me in the dropship. “The fire is burning,” I said.

“And the truth is turning,” Barakiel responded. “But we’ll need more than quoted scripture from you in the upcoming battle, Brother Kaephis.” The armored captain looked at the rest of the Flame Guard squadron. “That goes for all of you. We’re going up against the Fallen Legion, we all need to keep our wits about us.”

“They will be ash under our boots,” Seraphina spoke up. “Glory to the Forge Father.”

“Glory to the Forge Father,” I murmured in prayer along with my brothers and sisters in the faith.

Suddenly, the drop lights came on. “Three-hundred feet above the enemy’s front line,” the pilot’s voice called back. “Won’t get any better than this. On your call, captain.”

Barakiel looked to the squadron. “Time to match works to your faith.” He turned towards Seraphina, who grabbed the talisman hanging from her neck and gave him a nod. Barakiel took hold of the release handle on the ceiling. “Team Firebrand, we’re dropping!”

He gave the lever a sharp pull, and the floor of the dropship opened beneath the five of us.

Seraphina called out a word of the Forge, and we felt her magic catch us, like the Hand of the Forge Father himself. Falling at a reduced pace with my squadron, I surveyed the battlefield beneath us.

The orderly lines of the Amaran forces were faltering as the unrelenting horde of the Fallen pressed against them. Seeing a location that was particularly weak, I relayed my intent to the Flame Guard and prepared to draw upon the Forge Father’s power. Once we reached about a hundred feet above ground, I brandished my shield, the emblem of the Forge glowing warmly on its front. Invoking the Forge, I ushered some of its fire onto the battlefield.

The roar of flame was audible above the clash of battle as a wall of fire erupted along a sixty-foot line where the fighting was most dire. The defending Amaran soldiers took a step back, unharmed, from before the fiery barrier. The Fallen, on the other hand, cried out in anguish as a swath of them retreated hurriedly from the oppressive heat of the damaging side of the wall.

Almost simultaneously, Seraphina threw a mote of fire towards the retreating Fallen, which exploded in a burst of flame, eliminating that portion of the enemy army.

“Look! Up there,” an Amaran soldier called out. “It’s the Flame Guard! The Forge Father smiles upon Amar this day.”

Our boots hit the ground in the area cleared by Seraphina, and we immediately began fighting the enemy. Dropping my concentration on the wall of fire, I summoned forth a ring of Forge Guardian spirits around me. We charged into the ranks of the Fallen, rebuking them with every swing of our weapons and every divine word from our lips. It wasn’t long before the tide of battle was turned, and the Amaran forces surged forward.

We continued to fight alongside the Amaran army for a time, until it became apparent that the battle was won.

“Our work here is done,” Barakiel called out over the fray. We all sheathed our weapons and joined hands in a circle. “To the FGS Prometheus!” he pronounced.

Suddenly, the chaos of battle was gone, replaced by the metal interior of our mothership, the FGS Prometheus. A glowing teleportation circle faded beneath us.

“Well done, team Firebrand,” Barakiel said, letting go of the hands of those next to him. “Another ally of the Forge Father safeguarded. Dismissed.”

The circle broke, Barakiel headed for the captain’s quarters, while the rest of us walked towards the common area. Other Flame Guard squadrons warped in at the teleportation circle; we weren’t the only ones to participate in the battle against the Fallen that day.

“Brother Kaephis!” a voice called out from the direction of the hanger bay. Turning, I saw our pilot approach, one hand holding her helmet, the other waving at me.

“Hello, Sister Claria,” I said, “I presume the flight back was uneventful?”

She hurried to join our group. “I just got back. It’s not even funny how short work you guys make of the Fallen. It’s like they’re made of dry straw. Just, FWOOOSH and they’re gone!”

I nodded, smiling underneath my helmet. Claria’s casual speech was common among the pilots, even though Barakiel frowned upon it. I personally found it refreshing.

“Keep your head covered, Sister Claria,” Seraphina scolded. “It’s unbecoming of a Fire Guard disciple of the Forge to be so disrespectful.”

Claria smiled cheekily and pulled her red hood up. “I guess my hair is pretty messed up from sweating inside that helmet. You’d know all about that, wouldn’t you, Sister? Must be why you keep your helmet on so much.” She winked at Seraphina.

Seraphina huffed and turned away from Claria.

“Anyway,” Claria continued, “looks like we’re about done here on Amar. Any guesses on where we’re headed next?”

“Wherever the Forge Father needs us,” I replied.

“Boo,” Claria pouted, “cop out answer. I think we’re going to Jangala, or maybe Corvus. Both planets have got their problems they’re dealing with, and they both have been keeping up on their devotions as well.”

“Like you would know anything about devotions,” Seraphina called back.

“Oh, hey!” Ciaria said. “Didn’t know you were still listening. And I do keep up on my devotions, thank you very much. I make sure to pray to the Forge Father as the last thing I do every night.”

Seraphina scoffed. “I’m sure that’s because you fall asleep mid-sentence.”

“Have you seen my scriptures?” Claria said. “There are tear stains on almost every page.”

“Are you sure those aren’t drool marks?”

I was glad my helmet hid my grin as I watched the two disciples go at each other.

“Enough squabbling,” Markanius spoke up. “You’ll give us all a headache.”

The rest of the day passed, filled with good food and pleasant company, easing the weight of battle and responsibility on our shoulders. Bidding farewell to my comrades, I retired to my chambers. Doffing my armor, I knelt at my bedside.


The fire of faith,

Within me it burns.

The gear of truth,

Within me it turns.

Through battle and blood,

Through ice, sand, or mud,

My faith will not grow cold,

Nor my truth turn old.

I am a child of the Forge,

Forge Father bless me, so that I may bless others.
