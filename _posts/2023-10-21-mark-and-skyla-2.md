Mark walked along the greenway, hands in his pockets. Afternoon light filtered in through the trees, creating splotches on the pavement. Skyla’s form swirled into existence next to him.

“Heya, Marky!” she greeted. “Whatcha doing?”

“Walking,” he answered.

“I can see that,” Skyla said, rolling her eyes. “I meant why are you walking, or where are you going.”

“Nope,” Mark said, “just walking.”

Skyla squinted at him, then at the surrounding forest.

“Is this one of those ‘appreciating nature’ moments?” she questioned.

“Something like that,” Mark replied.

“Well, if you can do it,” Skyla said, folding her arms, “I can do it too.”

Skyla faced in the direction they were going, a pout on her face. After about ten seconds, she slouched, sighing and hanging her arms loose while turning her eyes upwards.

“Ugh, I don’t see how you can do this,” she complained. “It’s waaaaaay too boring.”

“I guess even the simple aspects of life are too hard for you to comprehend,” Mark said simply.

Skyla zipped directly in front of Mark’s face, causing him to stop walking.

“I’ll have you know that I compri… compra… I know about a lot more than you do!”

“Like what?” Mark asked innocently.

“Like…” she stopped, and her eyes narrowed. “Nice try, Marky, but you ain’t gettin’ anything out of me!” She flitted back to just above his right shoulder and didn’t speak again the entire walk home.
