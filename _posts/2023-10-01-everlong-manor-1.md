Trevor hurried down the halls of the Victoria Wing, messenger bag slung across his shoulder. His feet thudded against the red, embroidered carpet as he ducked and weaved between various guests and staff. A few called out to him in either greeting or frustration, but most ignored the small boy as he made his way toward the main ballroom.

Upon reaching the great hall, Trevor made a beeline for the grand stairway. If the host wasn’t there, he’d at least be able to survey the crowd from the superior height. Pushing his way through the mingling guests, he finally reached the far end of the hall. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw his target chatting with some guests near the base of the wide stairs. Stepping up to a respectable distance, Trevor stood waiting, catching his breath and fishing a wax-sealed letter out of his messenger bag.

After a minute of waiting, the host finished his conversation with the guests and turned toward Trevor.

“Yes?” the man said, his smile too perfect to be real. “Can I help you?”

Trevor gulped and shoved the letter toward the host. “Message for you, milord.”

Plucking the letter from Trevor’s outstretched hand, the host looked it over briefly before breaking the seal and reading the letter. A moment passed. Trevor stood as still as he could, a bead of perspiration trickling down the side of his face. At last, the host looked up from the letter with the same smile as before.

“Thank you, young man,” the impeccably dressed man said. “Do you have time for me to send a reply?”

“Always, milord,” Trevor said.

The host nodded and turned toward the stairs, beckoning Trevor to follow. Trevor hurried after the host, the man’s long strides making him trot to keep up. They ascended the stairs together, Trevor making sure not to overtake the host. After the stairs, there was a short walk to one of the many doors on the upper floor. The host reached into his suit and pulled out a ring of crystal keys that glimmered unnaturally in the light. Selecting one, he inserted it into the keyhole and turned it. A faint, prismatic light shimmered around the edge of the door for a moment, then the man grasped the doorhandle and opened the door, revealing a luxurious office.

Looking toward Trevor, the host lifted a finger. “Wait here for just a moment,” he said, and he stepped inside and closed the door.

Trevor had barely started to relax when the doorknob turned again, just a few moments after the door had closed. He jerked to attention as the dark, wooden door opened. A large woman exited the room, shutting the door immediately behind her. Trevor blinked at the guest. She looked down at him with a friendly smile.

“Did you need to use the washroom?” the woman said. “It’s open now.”

“No, ma’am,” Trevor said, standing stiff.

“Oh, then perhaps you have a message for me?”

“No, ma’am,” Trevor repeated, trying to maintain a neutral expression.

“Well,” the woman said, “I’ll take my leave then. Do take care not to stand around too long, you might be reprimanded by one of the hosts or head staff for shirking your duty.”

“Yes, ma’am,” Trevor responded. “Thank you, ma’am.”

Giving Trevor one last fake smile, the woman turned and headed down the grand stairway to rejoin the party. Trevor was still trying to make sense of the whole thing when a shimmer of light edged the doorway. Shortly thereafter, the host exited.

“Sorry for the wait,” the host said, shutting the door behind him.

“Not a problem, milord,” Trevor said, trying to keep the confusion out of his voice.

The host looked at him. “You’re a little pale, are you feeling all right?”

“Right as rain, milord,” Trevor managed.

The host nodded slowly, then held out a package wrapped in brown paper and tied up with twine, the words ‘personal delivery’ stamped onto it.

“I need you to take this to the main host of the Quincey Wing, promptly.”

Trevor’s eyes bulged, his befuddlement about the nature of the mysterious room and the occupants thereof clearing from his mind in an instant. “The Quincey Wing, milord?” Trevor stammered.

“Yes,” the host said, “I trust that you’ll take it there safely?”

Trevor’s mind whirled. He’d heard of the Quincey Wing --- everyone had --- but he’d never been anywhere near there. He’d have to go through the Winston, Bellflower, and Lowe wings, along with a half-dozen others that he didn’t even know the name of. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.

“Well, young man?” the host said, not a trace of impatience in his countenance.

“Milord,” Trevor managed, “that’s several days journey. Where will I sleep? What will I eat?”

The host sighed, a smile still on his face. “The devil’s in the details, isn’t he? I imagine your fellow staff will be able to help you. Now, can I trust this with you? If you feel you aren’t up to the task, I can always talk with your supervisor to get me a replacement…”

“No, milord,” Trevor said quickly. He swallowed and accepted the parcel. “I’ll do it.”

“There’s a good man,” the host said. “Now, I must get back to my guests. Take care in your journey, young man.” With that, the suited man walked away, leaving Trevor stunned. He looked at the package in his hands. The Quincey Wing? Really? He put his right foot behind his other, shifting his weight to his back leg as he chewed the inside of his cheek. If he was going to survive the journey, he’d need some guidance. Luckily, he knew just the guy to ask.
