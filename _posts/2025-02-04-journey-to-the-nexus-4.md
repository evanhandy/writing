Typhan, Della, and the Muddan elder sat around the relighted fire in the council hut. Della had her feet propped up in front of the fire, trying to melt the ice from her feet.

“I’d hoped that the Glacians wouldn’t come to our valley,” the Muddan elder muttered as he prodded the fire with a stick. “But when a blue Magmari appeared, I feared the worst.”

“Why should we fear the Glacians?” Typhan asked. “And what does Alam have to do with any of this?”

“To answer your first question,” the Muddan elder said, “the Glacians haven’t always been a threat, but with the current ruler of the icelands, things have changed.” He gazed up at the smoke rising through a hole in the roof. “Their leader, he calls himself the Ice Emperor, has declared all the world his domain.”

“That’s crazy,” Della said, shifting her feet. “Glacians couldn’t survive the hotter regions of the world, let alone rule it.”

“That’s what we thought initially as well,” the elder said. “However, over the past few years, the traders that make their way to our valley came with troubling news.” He looked at Typhan and Della. “Apparently, the icelands are expanding.”

“But that’s impossible!” Della exclaimed. “Didn’t you teach us that the lands are tightly connected to the Weave? It’s the Weave that dictates the biomes of the different regions.”

“You are correct, and I still believe that is the case. There is something else involved in the Glacian’s sudden increase in power.”

“What is that?” Typhan asked.

The elder sighed. “I do not know. Being as isolated as we are from the rest of the world, we rely on traders for our information. However, one thing we have heard is rumors of a blue Magmari, supposedly the Ice Emperor’s youngest son.”

“I remember the Glacian that attacked us calling him his brother,” Typhan said. “You’re saying they’re both Glacian royalty?”

“How does a Glacian come to have a Magmari child anyway?” Della added.

“I assume that yes, they were Glacian princes, but as for the blue Magmari, I do not know his story. One thing is certain though.” The elder paused and looked at Typhan and Della. “If we do nothing, what we witnessed today will be only a start of what is coming.”

A moment of silence passed over the group.

Della lifted a foot and inspected it. “Uh, how long is it supposed to take ice to melt?”

The elder furrowed his brow. “It should have melted by now.”

Della scooted over to the elder. “It looks as solid as it did when I came in. See?”

“This is troubling,” the elder muttered. He picked up some tongs and used them to pluck an ember from the fire. “Please hold still, I want to see if this will melt the ice. I won’t burn your foot.”

Della bit her lip as the elder pressed the ember against the ice attached to her left foot. There was a sizzling noise, but no visible melting of ice.

“It’s not melting,” Della breathed. “What do we do?”

The elder rubbed his chin. “Were your feet frozen in the initial blast?”

Della shook her head. “No, they froze to the ground outside.”

The elder nodded. “I fear that that Glacian’s power is far greater than I anticipated.” He looked at Typhan. “You both were partially frozen, yes?”

“That’s right,” Typhan said, “but the ice flaked off pretty quickly.”

“Perhaps the magic wasn’t able to fully set in,” the elder mused.

“What are you talking about?” Della asked, concern rising in her voice. “What does this have to do with my feet?”

“I don’t know exactly what’s going on,” the elder said, “but I’m afraid that ice isn’t going to melt.”

Della’s eyes widened. “What?”

“Never-melting ice?” Typhan exclaimed. “Such a thing exists?”

“Apparently so,” the elder murmured, “though it’s far too early to say ‘never.’”

“So, what do we do?” Typhan asked.

The elder met Typhan’s eyes. “You’ll find bowls in the other room along with some water pots and a trowel. Grab a bowl about as wide as your forearm, a pot full of water, and the trowel and bring them here.”

Typhan got up to retrieve the items. When he had returned, the elder was standing at some shelves near the walls of the hut, rummaging through a drawer.

“I have what you asked for, Elder,” Typhan said.

“Good,” the elder replied. “Now, dig up some dirt from the floor and put it in the bowl and pour the water over it. I would normally have you collect soil from outside, but that’s currently not an option.”

As Typhan worked, Della’s gaze shifted between him and the elder. “What are you going to do?”

The elder pulled some mud leaves and some string from the drawer and returned to Della. “We’re going to save your feet.”

Typhan brought the bowl of dirt and water to the elder. “Here’s the bowl.”

“Thank you,” the elder said, and he began mixing the water and dirt together with his hands. He looked at Typhan. “You’ll find some gloves in that drawer. You’ll need them to prevent the ice from freezing to your hands.”

“Why would it do that?”

The elder nodded towards Typhan’s sheathed pruning knife. “Because you’re going to separate the ice from her feet.”

Typhan grimmaced. “Isn’t there another way?”

The elder frowned. “I know little about Glacian magic, especially this enhanced kind. If we don’t move quickly, the ice might spread further.”

Typhan grit his teeth and nodded. Grabbing the leather gloves from the drawer, he moved next to Della.

The elder gave her a straight look. “This is going to hurt, I need you to be strong.”

Della chuckled grimly. “My feet are so numb right now, I’m not sure I’ll feel anything.”

The elder set the bowl of mud next to the fire and looked at Typhan. “Be swift and precise.”

Typhan took a breath and unsheathed his knife. He looked at Della’s feet, the large chunks of ice solidly frozen to the bottom of them. How was he going to do this? An image of the water trees came into his mind. The ice was just a branch that needed trimming. Biting his lip, he grabbed Della’s ankle with a hand, silently grateful he was wearing gloves, and brought his knife to the seam between her foot and the ice. He pressed his knife against the meeting point. Della flinched, causing Typhan to jerk back his blade. A small cut on Della’s foot oozed mud.

“Sorry,” Typhan said, “did that hurt?”

“I’ll be fine,” Della grunted, her face turned away from the procedure. “Just get it over with.”

“Do you need me to do it?” the elder asked.

“No,” Typhan said, “I can do this.”

Moving with determination, he began working the knife between Della’s foot and the ice. She trembled as he worked, and once or twice there was a jerk, but soon, the ice plopped off her foot, the bottom of her foot heavily bleeding mud.

“Set her foot in here,” the elder said, bringing the bowl of mud over.

Typhan put Della’s foot in the bowl and then got to work on her other foot. It went quicker this time, now that he knew what to do. After less than a minute, both of Della’s feet were free of ice.

“Excellent work, Typhan,” the elder said, putting the foot in the bowl of mud. “You may have saved her feet from a worse fate.”

Della gasped. “That was awful! Remind me never to visit the icelands.”

“I’m afraid it’s too late for that,” the elder said. Della and Typhan both looked at him.

“Why is that?” Typhan asked.

The elder looked at him. “Because the icelands have already taken over our valley.”

Typhan blinked. “You mean, the ice won’t melt? Ever?”

“But the Glacian said the sun would melt it all!” Della protested.

The elder looked towards the frozen Aqualic woman in the entrance to the hut. “The fire didn’t melt the ice off of Della’s feet. I fear the sun might not be effective either. Remember, the Glacian also said he never remained in a place he froze over to see the long-term effects of his actions.” He looked between Della and Typhan. “Our valley is doomed. I can only hope some hid in their huts when the blast came, but everyone was following you and the blue Magmari boy to our hut. I fear most, if not all, were consumed by the ice.”

Typhan sat back, unable to say anything. His entire village was turned permanently into ice?

“There has to be something we can do,” Della said.

“There is,” the elder said. “Flee to the mudlands and pray the Glacians never extend themselves that far.”

“I don’t want to just run away,” Typhan said. “Is there no way we can save the valley? Our families?”

The elder was quiet for a moment, gazing into the crackling fire.

“There is one way,” the elder finally said.

Typhan and Della both sat at attention.

“The Glacians’ power must come from somewhere,” the elder continued, “and the wanton use of this power must be throwing the Weave out of balance.” He looked at Della and Typhan. “Go to the Nexus, the confluence of the elemental conduits and core of the Weave. Find out what happened to disrupt the natural order, and discover how to restore it.”

“Go to the Nexus?” Della repeated. “At the center of the world?”

“That’s impossible,” Typhan said. “All the stories we’ve heard say that [placeholder for why it’s hard/impossible, I’ll figure that out as I write more and discover what exact trials lie between the characters and the Nexus].”

The elder gazed up at the ceiling. “[placeholder for path to take to reach the Nexus].”

Della and Typhan looked at each other.

“But what about you?” Della asked. “Are you coming with us?”

“No,” the elder said. “I must remain here. While I believe the ice won’t melt, there is always a chance that it might. I need to be here if that happens to help evacuate the villagers to somewhere safer.”

“What will you do for food and water?” Typhan asked. “Everything’s frozen.”

“In a way, that actually helps my situation,” the elder explained. “The mud melons will all be frozen outside. I should be able to carefully crack them open with the hope that they’re not completely frozen solid.” He looked at the trowel next to the hole Typhan had dug. “Being in the middle of the Clearwater Sea, it won’t be difficult for me to dig a small well for water.”

Typhan slowly nodded. “Okay, we’ll do it. We’ll go to the Nexus.”

“What about my feet?” Della spoke up. “I don’t think I can exactly walk right now.”

“Ah, yes,” the elder said. “Thank you for reminding me. That’s what the mud leaves are for.” He selected a couple of long, wide mud leaves and a length of string. “Mud leaves have soothing properties to them, let me tie them around your feet, it should help with the pain.”

Della pulled her feet out of the mud bowl and the elder bandaged them with the mud leaves.

“Of course, you’ll need shoes,” the elder said. “And enough covering to make sure you don’t accidentally freeze to the frozen watercliffs on your climb up.”

Della grimaced. “I hate shoes. I hadn’t thought about the climb either. How will we get a boat all the way up there?”

“You’ll have to learn how to shape mud into a canoe,” the elder said. “Climb up with a large basket full of mud and then form it into it’s proper shape.”

“You mean with magic?” Della asked, grinning.

The elder nodded. “I can teach you how to pull on the Weave to do this. It’s much like shaping the mud of your body into your current form when leaving mud form.”

Typhan stood up. “While you’re doing that, I’ll collect some clothes and enough supplies to get us to the mudlands.”

“I give you permission to check the other villagers’ huts for things you need,” the elder said, “but only if you don’t have them yourself. I can explain things to the villagers once they thaw.” He sighed. “If they thaw.”

“If the sun won’t melt them,” Typhan said, “Della and I will find a way to save them.”

The elder smiled. “May that be so.”
