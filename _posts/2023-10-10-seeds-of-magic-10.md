As Asher stepped through the doors leading outside, he took a sharp breath. The Mother Tree loomed before him. He had almost forgotten how close the first of all mage trees was. Craning his neck, he saw that they were directly beneath the outer reaches of its leafy branches.

“G-g-gosh,” Grover breathed, “it’s even bigger when you’re this close, and we’re not even at the b-basins.”

“Come on,” Ray said, “we’re not here to sightsee. We need to keep moving so that those behind us can get through the doors.”

Asher nodded and walked further into the field. Mages directed the youths to different parts of the field. Poles, ropes, and wooden structures were set up at various places, along with several large piles of small rocks in one corner. The field was free of snow despite the season. Asher wondered if the mages did it or if the Mother Tree kept the field snow-free. The air wasn’t too cold either.

A mage gave Asher and his roommates each a blank card, then they were ushered along with about a quarter of the youths towards the corner of the field with the rocks. Two dozen long, narrow lanes of grass about five feet across stretched down the field, picketed off by wooden stakes and rope. The piles of rocks rested near Asher and the others, and about fifteen mages stood by on both ends of the lanes.

“Grab a pair of casting gloves and select a talisman,” a mage standing next to a row of crates instructed. Asher and the others waited in line to get to the crates.

Asher watched a girl further ahead in the line who got to the crates before he did. After a moment of standing in front of the crates, she selected two gloves from one, and a small wooden disc from another. She put on the gloves and slipped the talisman into one of them before walking past the crates and towards the mages at the beginning of the lanes. She was guided by a mage to one of the piles of rocks, where she stretched out her hand towards the pile. The pebbles shifted and a small clump of them about the size of a head lifted out from the pile of stones and hovered in front of her in a ball. The mage accompanying her gestured toward a lane and she began walking down the field by herself with her arm extended, rocks held out in the air before her.

Ray whistled. “So, a carrying test, eh? Simple enough, but bound to expose weakness, especially with how long they’re having us carry it.”

As he said this, the girl Asher was watching stumbled, and a large portion of her floating bundle of rocks fell to the ground. She looked at the fallen pebbles for a moment before continuing more slowly down the lane. The other lanes each had a youth walking down them as well, small spheres of stones held out in front of them.

The mages only let one person be in a lane at a time, so it took about half an hour before Asher made it to the crates. Every ten minutes or so, a mage would run back from the far side of the field with a box of talismans which they emptied into the crate on Asher’s side of the field.

Upon reaching the crates, Asher looked at the selection of casting gloves. Each fingerless brown leather glove had a circular hole in the palm of the hand. He had never worn casting gloves before, but he knew about them from his books and his father who wore them when he used their family’s talismans. Asher selected a pair his size and pulled them on before moving to the crate of talismans. There was about thirty in the box, which was far more than Asher had ever seen in one place. That crate was probably worth more than two or three years’ worth of crops. Not that Asher would try to steal any.

The discs were of varying sizes, so Asher combed his hand through the box, looking for one that would fit comfortably in his glove. As soon as his bare fingertips touched the wood, a surge of power flowed into his body. The jolt made Asher jerk his hand back momentarily. These talismans had far more charge in them than his or Kindle’s fathers’ talismans. As he passed his hand through the talismans, images of stones and rocks floating filled his mind. Asher’s brow furrowed. Where were these thoughts coming from? Then his hand hit a talisman at the bottom of the crate.

*I hold things.*

Asher jumped and looked around. There were a lot of people nearby, but none of them were looking at him. What was that voice? He reached towards the bottom of the crate again.

*I hold things.*

Asher grabbed the talisman and pulled it out. He looked at it. It appeared similar to the talisman Kindle had shown him, the symbol for earth magic engraved on one side. Had the talisman spoken to him?

*I hold things.*

The voice seemed to be coming straight into his mind. What was going on?

“If you’re d-d-done,” Grover said behind Asher, “I need a talisman.”

Asher looked at him and blinked. That’s right, the line. He was holding it up.

*I hold things.*

“Sure, sorry,” Asher said, slipping the talisman under the wrist of his right glove. He situated it so that it was centered in his palm with the earth symbol facing outwards through the hole in the casting glove. He then stepped forward and let a waiting mage take him to a rock pile.

“Use the talisman to lift a ball of these pebbles,” the mage said in a voice that belied how many times he had said those same words that day. “Make the ball about the size of my head and walk down this lane to the other side. Don’t pick up any pebbles you drop. Allow the mage at the end of the lane to inspect what pebbles remain before depositing them in the pile you’ll find over there.”

*I hold things.*

Asher nodded. “I hold things.”

Both Asher and the mage blinked. He had meant to say, ‘sure thing,’ but those words had come out instead.

“Yes,” the mage said, “good for you. Now, take your time, let me know if you need any help activating your talisman.”

Asher nodded again and held out his right hand towards the rock pile. Time to see if the talisman was as good as its word. He envisioned a clump of pebbles of the size instructed rising from the pile of stones. Exhaling slowly, Asher let out a small portion of the talisman’s power.

Immediately, a tight clump of small stones rose from the pile, approximately the size of the nearby mage’s head.

*I am holding pebbles.*

Asher blinked again. Would he have to deal with this all the way to the other side? Who knew talismans could be so talkative! The mage gestured towards the lane, and Asher turned towards it. The lane stretched on for what seemed like forever. Asher couldn’t make out the expressions of the mages on the other side, they were so far away. He started walking down the lane at a slow pace. After seeing hasty kids stumble and drop their pebbles, Asher decided it was worth it to be careful.

Ray had been in front of Asher in line, and he was a good hundred feet down the lane on Asher’s left. Grover got into the lane on Asher’s right, and soon all six of them were trekking down the field together. A minute passed uneventfully. Asher didn’t dare take his eyes off of his payload, making sure not to let any stones drop. As he walked, there were more and more pebbles on the ground from where the other applicants had dropped theirs. Asher made sure to watch his footing. The talisman continued to remind Asher that it was holding pebbles, and soon Asher was able to tune it out.

After the second minute, Asher started to feel more sure of himself. He hadn’t dropped a single rock so far. Looking up, he saw that Ray only had a bundle about the size of his fist left. Asher quickly returned his focus to his own clump of rocks. He didn’t have spare mental capacity to worry about how he was doing compared to others, he just had to do his best. For his family.

Asher was about halfway down the field when his arm started to get tired. That wasn’t good. It had taken him a little over two minutes to get up to that point, and he didn’t know if he could hold out to the end. He gritted his teeth. He had to. Using his left arm to support his right, Asher continued down the field. He was about three quarters of the way there when his right arm started to drop. His shoulder was burning, and his wrist hurt from pointing his palm forward all this time. This was no magical competency test, this was a physical endurance test!

Then Asher remembered. In his reading, he had learned that talismans can not only be used to influence the elements, but also strengthen the user. Earth was all about being strong and sturdy. It would make sense if he would be able to draw on the talisman’s power to reinforce his arm. The question was, could he both do that and keep the pebbles afloat at the same time with the same talisman? He supposed there was only one way to find out, but he needed to act fast, his arm was beginning to shake.

Asher stopped walking. He needed all of his focus to pull this off.

*I am holding pebbles.*

Can you hold me too? Asher thought forcefully. He imagined the strength he felt in the talisman running into his arm all the way up to his shoulder. At the same time, he tried to split his attention and focus on keeping the pebbles afloat too.

A burst of power shot through Asher’s arm, and he found himself flinging his hand towards the sky due to the sudden jolt of strength. The rolling ball of rocks followed his motion, swinging towards the space above his head. In shock, Asher lost his concentration, and the pebbles went sailing into the air, following their upward course. The stones flew high in the sky, the ball losing its shape and spreading out as the pebbles reached the height of their trajectory before beginning their speedy descent towards Asher.

*I hold things.*

“Well, how about you hold those!” Asher cried out, closing his eyes and thrusting his hand upwards. A sound of rushing earth burst behind him, followed by the noise of pebbles hitting the ground and Grover yelping.

*I am holding five pebbles.*

Asher opened his eyes. He was shaded from the sun. Turning to see the source of the shade, he gasped as he saw a giant, earthen hand sprouting from the ground, cupped palm open towards the sky. Looking around, Asher saw Grover on his knees, both hands covering his head. Nearby, he saw Gale, Jasper, Graff, and other applicants looking at him with wide eyes. The earthen hand crumbled to the ground.

“Oh my gosh,” Asher said, rushing over to where Grover was, “are you all right?”

*I hold—*

Asher tore off the glove and tossed aside the talisman. Grover looked up at Asher.

“I’m f-f-f-fine,” he managed. He gazed at the pile of pebbles on the ground in front of him and sighed. “Not f-fine.”

“I’m sorry,” Asher said, biting his lip, “I lost all of mine too. I’ll talk to the mages, maybe they’ll let you off easy. This was all my fault.”

Grover nodded. Asher saw a tear run down his cheek.

“Did any of them hit you?” Asher asked. “Come on, we’ll walk together.”

They turned towards the end of the lane to see a mage running down Asher’s lane.

“Hey, you boys,” he said, coming up to a stop near them. He gestured towards the pile of dirt left by Asher’s earthen hand, and it sank back into the ground. The mage put his hands on his hips and looked at the two of them.

“I’m assuming you didn’t mean to do that,” the mage asked Asher. Asher shook his head.

“Good,” the mage said. “You two can come on down to the end here, you’ve completed this trial. Can I see your talismans, please?”

Grover sniffed and pulled out the talisman from his glove and handed it to the mage. Asher picked up his talisman.

*I hold things.*

“This talisman is talking to me,” Asher told the mage. “Is that normal?”

The mage accepted the talisman and looked at it.

“There are some people who are rather sensitive to the trees’ voices,” he responded, “and there are some talismans that are more… verbal than others. If it’s troubling you, try to find a talisman that doesn’t speak in the next trial.”

Asher nodded. The mage took the boys to the end of the lane where he deposited the talismans in a box. He then sat on a simple chair in front of a small table with a quill and ink on it. He picked up the quill.

“Now, can I see your cards?”

Asher and Grover handed the mage their cards that they had received when they first entered the field. He asked for their names, writing them down on the cards before handing them back. When Asher took back his card, he noticed the mage had also written ‘Earth trial,’ followed by the letter ‘P’ in the top left corner of the card just under Asher’s name.

“What d-d-does ‘C’ mean?” Grover asked, looking at his own card.

“Don’t worry about it,” the mage reassured him, “you’re not going to be kicked out or anything based on just one test. Follow the other kids to the next trial, please. And good luck.”
