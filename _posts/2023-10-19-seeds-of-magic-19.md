“Come on, everybody! Get your grub!”

Asher and his roommates moved in the line for breakfast the next morning in amazement. There, serving up food in a messy white apron, was Marina.

“Hurry it up, people!” she yelled. “This food isn’t going to eat itself.”

Asher picked up a plate, dumbfounded. What was Marina doing helping out with breakfast?

After accepting their food from the loud girl, the boys made their way to a table and began eating.

“Isn’t that the same g-g-girl from yesterday?” Grover asked around a mouthful of pancakes smothered in syrup.

“Pretty sure,” Ray said, stabbing a sausage with his fork. “I guess this is what you call just desserts?”

“More like just breakfasts,” Gale said, grinning.

“Serves her right,” Jasper said, swirling a cup of orange juice. “That should teach her to respect the Ascension Trials more.”

Just then, Asher heard Marina start singing at the top of her lungs.

Grover’s eyes widened. “Oh d-dear,” he said. “Of course she’d start singing that song.”

“What song?” Gale asked.

“It’s an old sea-shanty from the W-water Province. Everybody knows it, but they usually change the lyrics around children.” Grover cringed. “She seems to be singing the original version.”

Marina continued belting out the song. The tune was catchy, but the words were foul.

Jasper sat with his mouth open. “The disgrace!” he managed to say.

Ray chuckled. “I think it’s kind of funny.”

Apparently others thought so too, as several of the youths and mages joined in, most changing out some of the worst words for more appropriate ones. Others still started clapping along with the rhythm. As the verses continued, more and more people picked up on the chorus, and soon the entire dining hall was in an uproar.

Asher refrained from singing, but he couldn’t keep the smile off his face. Grover, Gale, and Ray all sung along, but Jasper and Graff kept silent.

Eventually, what seemed like the final verse rolled along, and everybody shouted the chorus before ending with thunderous applause and laughter.

It was then that the doors to the dining hall banged open.

“What disrespectful nonsense is going on here?” a booming voice called out, silencing the jovial aftermath. Asher turned and looked as a large man in indigo robes stepped into the dining hall.

“Who started that song?” he demanded. Everyone looked towards Marina. The man stormed towards her. “You again? What came over you to incite this irreverent outrage?”

Marina looked up at the man with a smirk on her face. “Just keeping spirits high as I carry out my sentence, sir.”

The man’s face tuned red. “Are you trying to be expelled from the Trials?”

“I’d prefer not to be.”

“Then I recommend being more mindful of how you act around here.” The man spun around to face the applicants. “And don’t think I didn’t hear the rest of you lot join in in this degenerate excuse for a song. This is an institution of the most elevated learning, built at the base and on the boughs of the Mother Tree. There’s no place for such foul lyrics here where the best and brightest rise to the occasion and take their places as mages of the nation.” He turned back towards Marina. “Some, however, throw away this precious opportunity with their immaturity and disrespect.”

The man lifted his gaze to the mages in the serving area. “I am ashamed some of our current mages participated in this insult to our good name as well. It seems too much time away from the Mother Tree has weakened your wills. I will be putting in a recommendation that all of your services in the Trials this year are extended for a month. As for you,” the man said, returning his attention to Marina, “as this is the second time you’ve acted up, I’m penalizing you with two marks against your record.” He looked back at the dining youths. “Each of you will also receive a mark against your record.”

Asher’s heart sunk. A mark against all of their records?

“But some of us didn’t sing,” one girl piped up. Jasper nodded vigorously in agreement.

“Then let this be a lesson to further strengthen your resolve against this debauchery.” With that, the mage strode swiftly out the doors before any more complaints could be made.

Hundreds of angry eyes turned towards Marina. Seemingly oblivious to the animosity, Marina glared at the doors where the mage in indigo robes had left.

“A mark against our record?” Gale asked, drawing Asher’s attention back to his table. “What does that mean?”

“It means we’re all one step closer to being thrown out of the Trials,” Jasper muttered. “And for what, a few verses of nonsense that I didn’t even join in on?”

“I d-d-don’t envy that Marina girl right now,” Grover said.

“I don’t envy us right now,” Gale said. “I don’t want to flunk out this early in the Trials.”

“It’s okay,” Ray said, putting a hand on Gale’s shoulder. Ray looked in the eyes of everyone in the group in turn. “We’re going to be okay. Overall, yesterday went well. I don’t think we have to worry about being expelled any time soon. If we work together, we can all make it through today. Then this week. Then this month.”

“Work together,” Jasper scoffed. “I just got a demerit for being lumped in with you people.”

“Stand together or fall apart,” Ray said. “It’s your choice.”

“The fires of the forge burn out the impurities,” Graff said. “It’s the setbacks that make us stronger.”

Ray gave Graff an appreciating look. “Well said, Graff. Now, like Marina said earlier, this food isn’t going to eat itself. We’re going to need all the strength we can get to pass today’s trials with flying colors.”

The boys all nodded and continued eating. Asher stole another glance at Marina. The girl seemed more somber as she dished out food to the applicants without speaking. He wondered why she had entered the Trials. If it was for any important reason, she’d have to clean up her act if she didn’t want to be eliminated soon. Either way, he hoped she would keep him and the other applicants out of it.
