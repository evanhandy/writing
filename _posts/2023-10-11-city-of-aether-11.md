Kassie woke up feeling much better. Her headache had cleared, her breathing was smooth, and she wasn’t feeling feverish. She grabbed the bucket and hocked a loogie into it. There were only a few streaks of blood in what she coughed up. She imagined it was what had accumulated during the night. Checking her magic levels, Kassie sensed only the slightest dampness at the bottom of her internal well of power, but it was no longer bone dry. Sitting up, Kassie stretched and yawned. She heard some shuffling in an adjoining room, and soon Diana walked in.

“Well, good afternoon, sleepyhead,” Diana said.

Kassie stopped mid-stretch. “Afternoon?”

“Yeah, you were out cold. How are you feeling?”

“I’m doing a lot better,” Kassie said.

Diana leaned against the door frame. “So, does this mark day one?”

“Day one?” Kassie asked.

“Of being out of the house.”

“Oh, yeah, it does.”

“How does it feel?”

“I don’t know,” Kassie said after a moment. “Weird? Freeing?”

Diana nodded. “Valid response. The first few days can be interesting for sure, more so if you don’t have a place to crash.”

Kassie blinked. She could piece together what Diana was saying, but occasionally the woman used different words and phrases than what Kassie had grown up with.

“So, how long were you sick for?” Diana asked. “This seemed to be the tail end of it, if you’re feeling so much better.”

“Not long, I think it was due to the stress of leaving home,” Kassie said.

Diana narrowed her eyes. “You sound truthful, but that must have been a heck of a stressful departure if it caused you to start coughing up blood.”

“Yeah, you could say that,” Kassie said, shifting her eyes to the side. “Honestly, I was just as surprised by my symptoms as you were.”

Diana shook her head. “Sometimes the human body does things that I do not understand.”

“Thank you for taking me in,” Kassie said. “Sorry about ruining your bedsheets.”

“It was an emergency, I’ll let you off for that one. But if you’re looking to stay here long term, you’re gonna have to start paying rent at some point.”

Kassie blanched. “Rent? But I don’t have any money.”

“Then go find some work,” Diana suggested.

“Work?”

“Did you really run away from home without a plan of how to survive?” Diana asked, smiling.

“Of course not! Well, kind of. I mean, yeah.”

“Perfect!" Diana said cheerfully. “Young, incompetent people like you are the best people to be around.”

Kassie’s face flushed at being called incompetent. “How so?”

“Kids like you remind me a lot of myself when I was your age, except I had nothing but the harsh world to teach me how to fend for myself.”

“You were a runaway too?”

Diana nodded. “Now that I’m in a more stable position, I want to give kids like you a proper fighting chance.”

“So, you’re going to teach me?”

“Helping you not go through what I had to go through makes me feel good, and I like feeling good.”

“Glad I can help,” Kassie muttered.

Diana laughed. “For starters, let’s get you looking proper.” She tossed a bundle of clothes toward Kassie who caught it. “Those should fit you well enough to keep you decent. I’ve got a washroom you can clean yourself up in. Once you’re done with that, we’re hitting the town.”
