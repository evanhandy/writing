Alam sat on the hard metal bench in his cell on Milas’ ship. After the spike-roller had climbed back up the frozen watercliff, it entered the waiting ship which then began its long trip back to the Glacian Empire. Back to his father. The reinforced door to Alam’s cell squealed open, and Milas stepped inside.

“Hello, Alam,” Milas said sweetly. “Are you faring well?”

“I said I’d behave,” Alam muttered. “What more do you expect?”

“I want you to thrive, of course,” Milas enthused. “Why don’t you come out of your little cell and sit with me on the decks?”

Alam glared at Milas. “I’d rather sit on this metal bench than in a throne next to you.”

“Then I’ll join you here.” Milas tucked his luxuriant robes under him and sat next to Alam.

“Aren’t you worried I’ll burn your robes?” Alam droned.

Milas laughed. “My cold is far too powerful to be outdone by your fledgling abilities.” Even as he spoke, frost crept across the metal from where he sat, avoiding the spot where Alam was.

“Why did you freeze the village, Milas?” Alam asked. “They didn’t do anything. You could have just frozen the watercliff.”

“Why?” Milas said, raising an eyebrow. “To keep the mud off my robes, of course.”

Alam ground his teeth. “If that was the reason, why not send a representative? I’m sure one of your lackeys would dive into mud for you.”

“I knew you can be… difficult. Father sent me to collect you personally, and I don’t do mud.”

“Are innocent lives so meaningless to you that you would sacrifice them over your cleanliness?”

“Of course,” Milas said. “But remember, those aren’t innocents. They’re outsiders, people not under the Empire’s banner. If anything, I’m just preparing the way for our future expansion.”

“Are the icelands not enough?” Alam fumed. “Why do you all feel the need to seize lands that aren’t even aligned with your element?”

Milas looked at him flatly. “We’ve talked about this before. Father aims to make all lands part of the icelands. With our power, we can override the other elements and cover the world in ice.”

Alam searched his brother’s eyes. “You really believe that.”

“With all my heart,” Milas affirmed.

Alam sighed. “And you wonder why I ran away from home.”

“I do indeed wonder,” Milas agreed. “Your family is all in the heart of the icelands, why leave?”

Alam said nothing.

Milas looked forward at the blank metal wall. “I suppose you might be wondering what the homeland of your mother looks like. Rest assured, we’ll get there someday. Quite the dreadful place, I’m told. Why else did she flee to the icelands?”

“I don’t know, you all tell me a different story each time I ask.”

“The details are hazy in my mind. She was already living at the palace when father first noticed her. She was the only one of the Magmari servants that could endure his touch without freezing. He was quite intrigued by this, and with his loneliness after losing his first wife, decided to marry her.”

A moment of silence passed.

“Father was quite surprised when you were born, you know.” Milas confided. “He was sure that his cold was so strong that he’d only have Glacian children.” He chuckled. “I still remember his face when he heard the news that you were a Magmari.”

“A proper father would be there when his child was born,” Alam murmured.

“You mean a common father,” Milas corrected. “Our father is far too busy with more important matters to concern himself with such things. He already had an heir.”

“If I’m so unimportant, why not let me leave?”

“But you are important!” Milas insisted. “Look at you. A blue Magmari. A truly unique specimen. Father has seen that, and wishes for you to be by his side. You should feel honored.”

Alam glared at Milas. “I feel disgust.”

“Give it time,” Milas said. “You have yet a year before truly reaching adulthood. Father respects those types of things. Why not see what he can teach you in the meantime?”

Alam opened his mouth then closed it.

“I’ll let you think on that,” Milas said, standing up and dusting his robes. “You sure you don’t want more comfortable accommodations?”

Alam huffed. “Even if you actually trusted me with that, I’d feel sick riding in opulence after leaving an entire village frozen over.”

Milas shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He left the cell and closed the door with a clang.

Alam looked at his gloved hands. He wondered how Typhan and Della were faring. He clenched his fists. It would have been better if he had died in the watercliffs than to ruin the lives of those who saved him. But since he was still alive, he would do anything to oppose his father’s wishes of global domination.
