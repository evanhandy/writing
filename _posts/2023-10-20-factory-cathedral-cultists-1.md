Zen tugged on the side of his hood, pulling it forward to further cover his face. He knew that his countenance was already completely obscured by his black robes, but he still couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Leaving the street where he lived with his parents and siblings, he walked swiftly through the village. He practically jumped out of his robes when he heard a hiss from a nearby alleyway. Whirling around, he saw a dark hooded individual. His heart rate quickened for a moment before he remembered that black robes in shadowy alleys were friendly on Shift nights. He chided himself for his nervousness and went to join the unknown compatriot.

“Still jumpy, I see,” a feminine voice called from within the recesses of the dark hood, not without a hint of a smile. “How long has it been now since you became a Hand?”

“Three Shifts,” Zen said.

“Give it a few more months,” the woman said. “The nerves will fade.”

“As you say, Rain.”

Another hiss. “It’s Sister LeBlank on Shift nights, Brother Argent, you know that.”

Zen nodded. “Of course. Sorry.”

Sister LeBlank turned and gestured Zen to follow. “Come, we’ll miss the processional if we dally any longer.”

Together, Zen and Sister LeBlank walked along the cobblestone streets under the light of the full moon, ducking into alleyways whenever the occasional civilian crossed their path. Soon, they came to the blacksmith’s shop.

Sister LeBlank raised her hand to the door. A soft knock, two rapid ones, followed by a sharp rap.

It only took a moment for the door to open, and a large individual in a robe matching Zen and Sister LeBlank’s peered out. Zen looked up at the shadowy space beneath this person’s hood. Even with the sanctioned attire, there was no mistaking the local blacksmith, known on Shift nights as Brother Anvil. Stepping to the side, the brawny figure granted them access.

Zen entered the crowded shop. Six other robed individuals stood in a semi-circle. Brother Anvil shut the door behind them, and Zen felt his heart rate increase again. Somehow, he felt like he was being trapped in a room with people intending to harm him. He took a deep breath. These weren’t enemies, these were people he’d known from around the village for years. But now they were more than that. They were his Beloved Brothers and Sisters.

A tall, thin individual, Brother Devonshire, inclined his head. “All nine of us are accounted for,” he said simply. “We shall depart immediately.”

The room suddenly warped around them. Without time to brace, Zen stumbled. Sister LeBlank grabbed his arm and pulled him upright.

Regaining his footing, Zen found himself standing with Sister LeBlank and the others in the Churchyard. Looking around in the moonlight, Zen saw other groups of Hands meandering around the eroded tombstones, congregating into a line headed for the Cathedral. It appeared Zen’s group were among the last to arrive.

Folding his hands together into his robe sleeves, Brother Devonshire turned and led the group towards the assembling Hands. Zen likewise hid his hands within his sleeves, bringing them together in front of him. Walking in solemn silence behind Sister LeBlank, he looked up at the dilapidated spires of the Cathedral. The front of the weathered building was in the best repair, with the large central stained glass window still intact. The same couldn’t be said for the rest of the structure.

Lowering his gaze, Zen peeked past the shuffling procession of Hands to catch a glimpse of the main doors. They were open, a warm, orange glow leaking into the otherwise gray night. It seemed that the Work had already started.

It took about a minute to reach the entrance to the Cathedral where the Work was taking place. As Zen stepped through the threshold, the warmth of the furnaces replaced the cold atmosphere of the outdoors. The march of Hands continued through the gathering place and towards the back of the Cathedral. Zen ignored the rubble scattered across the floor and piled in the corners, but he couldn’t help but glance up again to see the juxtaposition of the ancient Cathedral roof and the bronze metal of the Workplace. Zen had learned to not ask questions, questions about who was once worshiped in the Cathedral, why it had fallen into such disrepair, and why the Workplace now occupied the collapsed section of the sacred edifice. He had his guesses, but they were just idle thoughts until he could get more information.

But why did he need information when there was the Work was to be done?

The heat of the furnaces became more intense as his group approached the Workplace, and Zen felt a bead of sweat slide down the side of his face. Sister LeBlank walked with Zen to his position, a humble spot which stood him in front of a wooden lever and a gauge. His was the sacred duty to pull the lever whenever the needle of the gauge reached the orange area. As his senior, Sister LeBlank supervised his Work while she performed her own labors nearby.

A loud whistle blew, signifying the beginning of the Shift.

The noise of a great churning filled the Workplace as the Work began in earnest. Hands at every position in the Workplace performed their various tasks. Some flipped knobs, others turned wheels, while others still pulled levers like Zen’s. He drowned out the orchestrated chaos around him and focused on the gauge in front of him. The needle slowly began to rise. He dared not ask what the gauge meant, or what horrible thing would happen if it ever reached the red area. All he knew was that this was the mission he was called to do, and that in his humble way, he was moving the Work forward. What the Work was exactly, Zen did not know. All he knew, and what Sister LeBlank promised him, was that this Work was the great hope of the future. It would change the world, and, just maybe, it would change him.
