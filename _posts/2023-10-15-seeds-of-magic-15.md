Splash!

Asher watched along with the others in line as a wavering ball of water fell to the ground in front of an applicant. Asher winced. The ball was supposed to be flung down one of the three long, picketed-off sections of the field, but apparently this kid just didn’t have it in him. The kid, a short boy with blond hair, stood with his hands outstretched, lower lip starting to tremble.

“I’m sorry,” the mage attending to him said, “that was your fifth try. You have completed this portion of the trial. Please return your talismans and see the mage at the desk for a grade.”

The boy sniffed and took out his talismans from his gloves and deposited them back into the box of talismans before shuffling dejectedly towards the desk where the mage sat waiting.

Ray looked at their group. They could’ve split up across the three lanes to get through faster, but they had decided to stay together, letting other participants cut in front of them to use the other lanes. “So,” Ray said, “who’s going first?”

“Oh! M-m-me!” Grover said, stepping forward towards the box. “I can show you all how it’s d-d-done. I’m from the Water Province, after all.”

“You’d think he was from the Air Province with how he handled the last trial,” Jasper muttered to the others.

Grover reached into the box and slipped a talisman into each of his gloves.

“This is just like a simple game we’d play b-b-back home whenever we could get our hands on a few water talismans. The trick is using one talisman to create the water and another to launch it forward,” he explained. “If you’re super in touch with sensing talismans, you can find ones better tuned to each task and use those. If not, you can p-p-probably still get decent results.”

He closed one eye and squinted down the field. Raising both hands, he furrowed his brow. An orb of shimmering water appeared in the air in front of him. It wobbled in place for a moment, then shot forward, flying a good hundred feet or so before splashing on the ground. Ray, Asher, and Gale all clapped. Grover wiped his brow and turned back to the group.

“Alright,” he said, removing the talismans from his gloves and depositing them back into the box, “who’s n-next?”

“I’ll go,” Graff said. He picked out a couple of talismans and stood at the end of the lane. He raised his hands like Grover did, and breathed deeply. A ball of water smaller than Grover’s formed. It lurched forward, falling only a few feet in front of him. Graff looked at the wet spot on the grass, then turned towards the attending mage.

“I can go again?” Graff asked.

The mage nodded. “If you are unsatisfied with your results, you may try again up to a total of five times.”

Graff turned back to the field and held out his hands again. This time, a slightly larger ball of water materialized in front of him. It stayed there for a good ten seconds, concentration written on Graff’s face. Then it launched forward, faster and farther this time, landing down the field about halfway to where Grover’s had landed.

Graff grunted. “Sufficient.” He turned away from the field, taking the wooden discs from his gloves.

Asher swallowed. “I’ll go next,” he said. He walked up to the box of talismans and reached his hand into it. Touching the various pieces of mage wood, Asher could easily tell which ones were for water creation and which were for water propulsion. He selected two powerful talismans, one of each type, and slipped them into his mage gloves before taking his place at the end of the lane.

“You’ve got this, Asher!” Ray called from the line.

Asher nodded and held out his hands towards the field. He had the creation talisman in his left glove and the pushing one in his right. Asher let a trickle of power flow from the creation talisman, focusing on a point just in front of his hands. A small bead of water appeared and hovered there. Asher increased the flow of power until the water accumulated so that the sphere was about the size of Grover’s. Asher was surprised that he didn’t need to especially focus to keep the water ball afloat as long as he let the flow of power continue. It appeared that the talisman was acutely tuned for this purpose.

Next, he had to launch the sphere forward. Intuition combined with his extensive reading told him that he would have to angle the trajectory if he wanted to get the maximum distance. Tilting his arms up a little, he let as much power flow from the propulsion talisman as he could. Instantly, the ball of water disappeared, turning into a distant speck flying high in the air, arcing gracefully over the field before eventually hitting the ground well beyond the end of the lane.

Asher’s heart thumped in his chest. He had gone full power without really thinking about it. Had he really done that? The sphere flew so far!

Ray whistled. “What a shot. It’ll be hard to follow that one up.”

“I’ll go next,” Jasper declared.

Asher numbly took the talismans from his gloves and placed them back in the box with the others. He handed his card to the mage at the desk.

“Well done,” the mage said, writing on his card. “It looks like you know how to really draw out the power of the talismans.” He handed the card back to Asher. It read, ‘Water trial,’ followed by the letter ‘S.’

“That was our last trial,” Asher said to the mage. “Where do we go from here?”

“Just find a spot to hang out,” the mage said, “once everyone’s done, we’ll break for lunch. Depending on whether you ate breakfast before or after your robe fittings will determine what order you eat in after this.”

Asher nodded and stepped off to the side. He watched Jasper as he tried to mimic Asher’s stance from before, but his mind was elsewhere. What a curious grading system. A ‘P’, two ‘B’s, and an ‘S.’ He didn’t know what to make of it. Hopefully it was enough to get him through the first day without being eliminated.
