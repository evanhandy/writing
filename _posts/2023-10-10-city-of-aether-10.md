Lucas stepped out of the stairwell to see Diana shutting her apartment door. She turned toward him.

“Looking for me?” Diana asked.

“Yeah,” Lucas said, “I think it’s really fixed this time. Wanted to let you do the honors of turning the water pressure back on, just so you know it’s working alright.”

Diana cocked an eyebrow. “You know I would’ve believed you had you just said it was fixed.”

“I know,” Lucas said, “it’s a matter of personal pride.” He turned and ran back up the stairs.

Upon reaching the fifth floor, Lucas looked down the stairwell at Diana still trudging up the steps.

“Do all grownups walk so slowly?” Lucas asked.

“It’s not that adults are slow,” Diana said, “it’s just that you’re ridiculously full of energy.”

Lucas rocked back and forth in place until Diana reached the fifth floor.

“Now,” Diana said, panting a little, “let’s see your work in action.”

They moved to the spot where Lucas had been working, and Lucas wormed through the access point and into the wall.

“Alright,” Lucas said, “turn it on.”

A few squeaks later, and there were no drips.

“We’re good!” Lucas announced, squirming his way out through the access point again.

Lucas started dusting himself off as Diana put the metal grate back over the access point and screwed it on tight.

“Excellent job, Lucas,” Diana said.

“I’m just glad the tenants didn’t notice that the hot water was off for six hours.”

“Oh, I had already told them before I got you,” Diana said.

“Oh, well, it’s on again now.”

Lucas and Diana stood in silent appreciation of a job well done for a few seconds.

“Did you still want that candy?” Diana asked.

“You know I haven’t forgotten about it,” Lucas said.

They started walking down the stairs, Lucas keeping pace with Diana this time.

“How’s the girl doing?” Lucas asked.

“She’s resting now,” Diana said. “She coughed up some more blood, which is better than having it sit in her lungs.”

“Yikes.”

“Found out a little bit about her,” Diana continued.

“Really? Like what?”

“First off, her name’s Kassie. I think that’s her actual name, too. She seemed a little too out of it to be coming up with lies. She didn’t give her last name, though.”

“Probably isn’t as interesting as mine,” Lucas bragged.

“Yours is a unique one,” Diana admitted. “However, there’s something different about this girl, Lucas.”

“Really? How so?”

“Did you notice her clothes?”

Lucas nodded. “They’re all old fashioned and poor like.”

“Exactly. She must be from some part of the city that’s either impoverished, backwards, or both. Don’t know how nearby it is, though.”

“Well, it couldn’t have been too far given the state that she’s in.”

Diana shook her head. “We don’t know when she contracted her illness. She might have been on the streets for weeks now.”

“That’s true. She did seem as surprised about her symptoms as we were.”

They reached the bottom of the stairs and walked to Diana’s apartment door.

Diana put her hand on the doorknob and paused. “Near or far, I’m going to let her stay here with us for as long as she thinks is necessary.”

Diana opened the door, and they both jumped. Kassie stood in the doorway. Red smears marked the front of her white shirt, and she peered at them from inside her mess of hair that partially obscured her face, bleary-eyed and with blood drooling from the corners of her mouth. She held onto a blue mug with both hands.

“Goodness me! You’re a fright,” Diana said, holding her hand to her chest. “For a moment there I thought you were some specter from the dead come to haunt us.”

“Needed some more water,” Kassie uttered huskily.

“Sound like one too. Here, let me get you that water.” Diana took the cup and went into the kitchen.

“What’s with the bloody shirt?” Lucas asked. “Did you cough into it?”

Kassie nodded, wiping her mouth on her sleeve. “Didn’t have time to grab the bucket.”

“Once you get better,” Diana said, returning with the cup of water, “we’re getting you new clothes.” She sighed. “And probably new bedsheets as well.”

“I’m sorry,” Kassie rasped, accepting the cup and shuffling back to the bedroom.

“Come on in, Lucas,” Diana said. “Let me get you that candy.”

“Where are you going to sleep tonight, Diana?” Lucas asked.

“On the couch,” Diana replied. “It’s quite comfy, actually. I’ve slept there a couple of times just because I was too lazy to get up and go to bed.”

Diana got the candy jar and poured out a few pieces into her hand. Lucas picked out a green, square candy, said goodnight to Diana, and left the apartment. Walking more slowly while sucking on the candy, Lucas climbed up seven flights of stairs before exiting the stairwell. He opened the door to the terrace and a cool breeze wafted over him.

Lucas breathed in deeply. The air wasn’t particularly clean up this high, but the coolness of the air was refreshing. Shutting the door behind him, Lucas went around and walked up the stairs that ran over the door and to the entryway of his little house. He opened the door and walked in. It was dark and cozy.

Spitting out the candy and placing it on the nightstand for tomorrow, Lucas kicked off his shoes and fell into bed. It had been a long evening, and he felt like he could use a good night’s rest. Before Lucas could think to stay awake and keep fiddling with his analytical engine, he had fallen fast asleep.
