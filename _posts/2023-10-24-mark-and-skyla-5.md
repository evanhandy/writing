Mark walked up the stairs of his apartment complex, laden with groceries.

“Heya, Marky!” Skyla’s chipper voice called out.

Mark turned his head to see Skyla sitting on the railing of the stairs.

“Hello, Skyla,” Mark said, walking past the demoness.

Skyla floated up off the railing and flew alongside Mark. “Wow, is all that food for you?”

“Yes.”

“Goodness, how do you keep your trim figure?”

“It’s not that much food, honestly,” Mark said. “Besides, it’s mostly all healthy stuff.”

Skyla made a face. “Blech, healthy.”

“I like it,” Mark said. “Healthy food and moderate exercise is good for the soul.”

They came to Mark’s apartment door.

“I’ve got this,” Skyla said, flitting to the doorknob and grabbing it with both hands. She was so small, it looked like she was hugging it. Shifting her body, she grunted.

“It’s locked.” Mark said, moving to set down one hand of groceries.

“I said, I’ve got this,” Skyla insisted. Letting go of the doorknob, she flew directly at the door. Instead of making contact with the painted wood, she passed right through, disappearing.

Mark heard a soft rattle from inside his apartment. A moment later, the door opened. Skyla zipped around the door and flew up in front of Mark’s face.

“Pretty slick, huh?” she said, smugly examining her nails.

“Good to know I can’t lock you out of my apartment,” Mark said, walking in and setting his groceries down on the kitchen counter.

“But since when were you able to keep me away anyways?”

“True,” Mark said, rummaging through one of the plastic grocery bags.

“Whatcha looking for?”

“This,” Mark said, withdrawing his hand. It was holding a hard caramel drop.

Skyla’s eyes lit up and her tail flicked back and forth. “Is that…”

“For you,” Mark said, holding out the candy.

Squealing, Skyla zipped over and picked up the candy. It was almost as large as she was. Despite the bulk of it, she managed to quickly tear off the wrapper. She immediately began licking the shiny caramel, her eyes rolling back.

“Enjoy,” Mark said, and he started putting away his groceries.
