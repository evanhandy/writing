“You’re really leaving, then.”

“Yup,” Asher said, “I sure am.”

It was less than a week from New Years, and the ground was covered in a thin layer of snow. Asher was leaving early the next morning with his father to head for the Mother Tree, the first mage tree and the location of the Ascension Trials. He was helping pack the family’s wagon with supplies for the journey when he had been approached by Kindle, one of his few friends in town.

“I wish I could go,” Kindle said, “but mum says I’m too young.”

“The rules do say you have to be eleven to join,” Asher said.

“I’ll be eleven next month!” Kindle said, stamping her booted foot.

“I guess they thought they had to draw the line somewhere. If you really want, you can go next year.”

“But it wouldn’t be fun without you there too,” Kindle pouted.

“I’m not going for fun, I have to go to help my family out.”

Kindle kicked at the snow. “Do you think you’ll make it?”

“Make it where?”

“To the end of the Trials, of course.”

“Nah, not even close. I’ll probably be kicked out after a month, maybe two if I’m lucky. I just have to hold out long enough to get my family through the winter.”

“I know,” Kindle said. “I really hope you do well and don’t get el… elima… I hope you don’t lose quickly.”

“Yeah, me too.”

Kindle jumped up and down, golden curls bouncing. “That’s actually why I came today!” She said, reaching into her jacket pocket. “The Ascension Trials are all about using talismans, right? Soooo…” She pulled out a thin, wooden disk that fit in her gloved palm.

“A talisman!” Asher said, eyes widening. Talismans weren’t rare, his family owned a few, but they were expensive and powerful, so they rarely let him touch them.

“I… borrowed it from my dad,” she said, looking around. “I thought you could use the practice.”

Asher took off a glove and accepted the talisman. The mage wood felt warm in his hand.

“Your dad’s plowing talisman,” Asher said reverently.

“Hey, how did you know what it was before I told you?”

Asher blinked. In his hand, the talisman’s use seemed obvious, but how had he figured it out? “I don’t know, actually. Is it his plowing talisman?”

“Yes, it is. Every spring he uses it to plow our fields. He’s not going to be needing it for several months, so I thought he wouldn’t notice if we borrowed it for a bit.”

Asher looked at the talisman. The mage wood was a medium brown with a dark grain. Flipping it over, he saw an emblem etched into the wood, the symbol for earth magic.

“Well?” Kindle said. “Are you going to use it?”

“Use what?” A stern voice interrupted. Asher turned to see his father approaching from the house, a bundle of food in his hands.

“What do you have there?” Asher’s father asked.

“It’s, uh, it’s…” Asher’s voice shrank. “It’s a talisman.”

“It’s my fault,” Kindle said, stepping in front of Asher. “I gave it to him. I wanted him to get some practice in before he leaves for the Ascension Trials.”

Asher’s father set the bundle of food down in the back of the wagon and looked at the two of them with folded arms. He sighed.

“I suppose that that’s only fair,” he said. “To be honest, I should have given you some more opportunities to practice.” He looked at the talisman in Asher’s hand.

“That your father’s talisman?”

“Yes, sir,” Kindle said.

Asher’s father held out a hand and Asher gave him the talisman. Looking at it closely, he nodded. “A plowing talisman, most likely. Tuned to churn and enrich the soil. While I don’t mind you trying your hand at using a talisman, plowing our backyard is probably not the thing to do. Here, take your father’s talisman, Kindle. I’ll be right back.”

Asher’s father returned with a small metal chest. Opening it up, he revealed several wooden disks resting on a velvet backdrop.

“These are fire talismans, tuned to warm the soil and invigorate plants. I use them to prompt the seeds to sprout in the spring, and to protect against any early frost in the fall.”

Asher picked one up. Like the earth talisman, it was warm to the touch.

“That talisman was trimmed from the mage tree in the market plaza,” Asher’s father said, “so in a way, it’s family.”

Kindle shook her head. “I still don’t understand how you could be related to a tree.”

“It’s not the tree itself we’re related to,” Asher’s father explained, “but rather the mage who harbored it’s seed. It’s close enough to make this very special.”

Asher looked at the talisman resting in his palm. It was strange to think that he had some connection to the wood, yet it seemed oddly familiar.

“How do you recommend I use this?” Asher asked.

“How about on the snow here?” Asher’s father said, indicating the ground away from the house. “Let’s see what you’ve got.”

Asher held the talisman towards the patch of snow, the fire symbol facing out, and closed his eyes. He had read a lot about talismans and knew conceptually how to activate one, though he had never done it in real life before. With his eyes closed, he could more acutely sense the wood in his hand. It almost seemed to vibrate in his grip, like it was brimming with energy. Opening his eyes, Asher looked towards the snow and willed the amulet to release its power.

A blast of fire shot out of the talisman with a loud whoosh. Asher yelped and dropped the piece of wood, shaking his hand. The stream of fire immediately ceased, and Asher’s father reached out a hand to steady him.

“Are you okay?” Kindle asked. The patch of snow where the fire had struck was gone, the grass underneath charred black.

Asher checked his hand. “Yeah,” he said, “I’m fine.”

“You’re lucky that a talisman’s power can’t easily hurt the user,” Asher’s father said. “What do you think went wrong?”

Asher thought. “I’m not sure. Maybe I tried too hard?”

“Good guess. I had a similar result the first time I ever used a talisman. Try again, but be less forceful this time. Let the power flow out, rather than push it.”

Asher gingerly picked up the talisman. The mage wood was glowing red and seemed to hum in his hand. It was a lot warmer, but not too hot to touch. The snow where the talisman had landed had melted. Selecting another patch of snow, Asher held out the talisman again. This time, he tried to slowly release the energy stored within the wood, rather than let it all loose. A circular portion of the snow about three feet wide began to steam. Soon it was melted, but the dead grass underneath remained unburned.

“Excellent job, son!” Asher’s father said, clapping Asher on the back.

Kindle jumped up and down. “Yeah! You did it!”

“I must say,” Asher said, “this does boost my confidence.”

“Keep up that pace of learning and you’ll do just fine in the Trials,” Asher’s father said, taking back the talisman and putting it with the others inside the metal chest. He looked at the sky. “Better say your goodbyes. It’s almost nightfall, and we’ve got a long day ahead of us.” He turned and went inside.

Asher turned towards Kindle. “Well, I guess this is—”

He was cut off by Kindle hugging him tightly. He stood stunned for a moment, then hugged her back.

“I’ll miss you,” she said.

“I’ll miss you too.”

“Come back soon, ‘kay?”

“But not too soon.”

“Right.” Kindle giggled and pulled away from the embrace. “You’ll have to teach me everything that you learn in the Trials.”

“I’ll do my best.”

Kindle shuffled her feet in the snow. “Well, goodbye, Asher.”

Asher waved. “See you later, Kindle.”
