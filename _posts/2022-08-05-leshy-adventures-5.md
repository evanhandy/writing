Once Gliss’s pond was out of sight, Axil slowed to a walk. “Thanks for backing me up, Wort.”

Wort reduced his pace as well. “Wherever you go, I’ll go. Except up a tree, I don’t do that.”

Axil chuckled. “I’ll make a note of that. Hopefully no fair maidens need rescuing up in trees.”

They walked in silence for a while. Soon, they heard the sound of a river up ahead.

“We must be nearing the ford,” Axil said. “Prepare yourself, Wort.”

Wort nodded and started muttering an incantation under his breath. A shimmering, translucent barrier materialized in front of him and followed his movements. Axil walked with his shield raised, eyes pealed for danger.

The ford came into view, a shallow passage that spanned a good ninety feet or so across the river.

“Wide river,” Wort commented. Axil nodded. It was much bigger than the stream that flowed through their village.

They reached the river’s edge. Axil took another look around. “I don’t see them yet,” he murmured.

The two leshies cautiously entered the ford. Some movement to the left upriver caught Axil’s eye. “There they are!” he called out, pointing with his sword. He charged into the water, positioning his shield between himself and the grindylows who were lurking in the river just off to the side of the ford. Three darts of force flew over Axil’s head, striking one of the grindylow, and Axil knew that Wort was joining the fight.

The grindylows swam quickly up to Axil. One of them attacked with a spear, while the other managed to bite into Axil’s sword arm. The one who bit Axil lashed out with a suckered tentacle, but Axil stepped to the side and it whiffed harmlessly past. Seeing this as an opportunity to strike, Axil pushed through the pain and swung twice at the gridylow, who ducked out of the way nimbly. Switching tactics, Axil went for a stab. The attack struck true, and the grindylow sank into the river with a gurgling wail.

Three more darts of force flew past Axil and struck the remaining grindylow in the chest and head. The grindylow reeled from the impact and turned to flee. Axil swung at the creature, but missed. Charging in after it, Axil swiped again, but the grindylow ducked under the water to avoid the blow. Suddenly, a magical burst of water spouted upwards, causing the grindylow to surface with a yelp. Another of Wort’s spells. With desperation in its eyes, the grindylow bit into Axil again before turning and jetting away with extreme speed. Axil frowned. He couldn’t travel that fast through the water, how would he catch the evil aberration?

Suddenly, Gliss strode out of hiding further up the river, gliding towards the grindylow with a determined expression. She swung at the creature, her fist striking the grindylow squarely on the side of the head. The creature cried out and went limp. Gliss put her hands to her mouth and leaned over the creature.

“Did I just kill it?” she exclaimed.

Axil, after making sure the other grindylow was dead, sloshed through the water to inspect the monster. “It appears you did. The wretched thing was on its last legs, or tentacles, as the case may be.”

Gliss hugged herself and shivered. “What horrid creatures.”

Axil noted the ichor flowing from the grindylow’s wounds. “We probably should pile the bodies somewhere away from the river.”

Gliss nodded. “I don’t want their bodies fouling the water.” She looked at Axil. “You’re wounded. After we take care of the bodies, come with me back to my pond, and we’ll see if there’s anything I can do for you.”
