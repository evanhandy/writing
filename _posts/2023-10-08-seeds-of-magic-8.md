Asher awoke to the sound of a bell tolling. A moment later, the talisman directly above his bed began emitting light. With groans and moans, Asher and the five other boys in his room started to stir. Squinting against the brightness, Asher sat up. Was it morning already? His room had a window, and looking through it, the light of dawn could be seen in the sky. Yawning, he climbed out of bed and joined the other boys who were looking at the long piece of paper on the wall to one side of the door.

“This must be our schedule,” a redhead said.

“What’s first?” A brawny boy dressed in sheepskin asked.

“Breakfast.”

“Where’s that?” Asked a tall boy.

“Look, a map,” the brawny boy said, pointing at another paper attached to the wall.

“Seems like it’s on the first floor of the center building,” the redhead said. “Just past the presentation hall. Can’t miss it.”

Asher peeked around the other boys at the map. It depicted the three main buildings he had seen so far, the two dorm buildings on either side of the courtyard, and what appeared to be a multipurpose building between them. A large field labeled ‘Practical Exercise’ was listed past the third building, towards the Mother Tree.

“Come on,” the tall boy said, “let’s eat. I’m starving.”

Asher retrieved his satchel and fished out his notebook. He started jotting down the schedule and a crude representation of the map. The other boys filed out of the room, except for the brawny boy who lingered.

“Another schedule?” The broad-shouldered boy said as he watched Asher.

“Yeah,” Asher said, still writing, “I want to know what we do next without having to come back to our room.”

The boy nodded. “Smart.”

“I like knowing what’s going on. My books don’t mention anything so specific as a schedule. Also, with so many kids, the schedule is probably different for different people, so they can maximize use of the limited space of the facilities, which means we may not find another schedule exactly like this posted elsewhere.”

The boy nodded again. “Makes sense.” He paused, folding his thick arms. “Books talk about the Ascension Trials?”

Asher looked at him. “Of course they do. It’s one of the most important topics in our country.”

“Can you tell me about what you have read?”

“Sure, but we better get moving, the other boys have left already.”

“Of course. My name is Graff.” The boy said.

“Asher.”

The two boys hurried down the stairs and into the courtyard. Swarms of youths were headed towards the building connected to the courtyard on the side opposite the gates.

“So, what do you want to know?” Asher asked as they entered the building and walked down its halls towards the dining hall.

“Everything,” Graff said.

Asher bit his lip. “That’s gonna be pretty hard to do. There’s so many topics to cover, the history of the Trials, the cultural impact, thematic musings by various authors, the list goes on. Maybe there’s something specific you’d like me to start with?”

“How to win,” Graff stated.

“Gosh,” Asher said, chuckling. “Headed straight for the top, are we? There are plenty of authors who have documented various parts of the Trials in detail, but they do say that the Trials change from year to year, so the specifics may not be as helpful.”

Graff harrumphed. “Not useful.”

Asher looked at Graff. It was hard to get a read on him, he seemed quiet yet forceful at the same time.

“Well, one thing all the accounts have in common is that the Trials test a mastery of practical talisman usage and theoretical knowledge.”

Graff’s brow furrowed. “Theoretical?”

“Exactly. I guess they don’t want people becoming mages if they don’t know what they’re doing.”

“But how—”

“Ah, here we are,” Asher said, pointing. Several sets of double doors opened into a spacious hall filled with tables and chairs. Hundreds of youths sat and ate. On one side of the room there was a long opening in the wall where food was being served. Their other roommates were seated near the doors, and they waved. Asher waved back and headed towards the serving area with Graff.

“Sorry, what were you saying?” Asher asked as he accepted a plate full of steaming meat and vegetables.

“Nothing.”

They returned to where their roommates were and sat down with their food.

“Welcome, slowpokes,” the redhead said. “We were just going through introductions. I’m Ray.”

“I’m Gale,” the tall boy said.

“Jasper,” said a boy with a large nose and ears.

“G-G-Grover,” the final boy stammered.

“Nice to meet you all,” Asher said. “My name’s Asher.”

“Graff.” Graff stated.

Ray began cutting his meat. “So, what element is everybody most excited about using in the trials and why? Maybe it’s my hair color, but I’ve always been excited about using fire.”

“W-w-water is what I’m looking forward to,” Grover said, smiling excitedly. “Conjuring it straight out of thin air sounds r-r-really cool.”

“I’ve been reading a lot about earth talismans,” Jasper said, depositing a fork-full of vegetables into his mouth, “they’re by far the most powerful.”

Asher mentally wobbled his hand in semi-agreement. Earth talismans were powerful to be sure, but air attuned mage trees kept entire cities afloat in the air province, and their talismans were essential in making airships.

“I want to experience the mobility that comes from using air talismans,” Gale said, waving his hand back and forth in the air.

Asher thought about what he would say. “All the elements are so unique with so many uses,” he finally said, “I really just want to try them all if I can.”

“Valid response,” Ray affirmed. “What about you, Graff?”

“Whatever is needed to pass the current test,” Graff stated, “because I’m going to finish the Trials and become a mage.”

All the boys looked at Graff. For a moment, no one said anything.

“That’s the spirit!” Ray cheered, clapping his hands. Gale and Grover joined in. Asher just looked at Graff in amazement. How could he say that with such confidence and purpose? He made it sound like he had already succeeded.

“So, why do you want to become a mage?” Ray asked. “I mean, besides the promise of overwhelming power.”

Graff was about to respond when one of the sets of double doors banged open. Heads from around the room turned and conversations halted as a girl with shoulder-length dark brown hair and black clothes stormed into the dining hall. A girl with pigtails followed closely behind.

“Marina, wait!” The girl chasing the other called out. “Breakfast isn’t on our schedule until later!”

“Like I care!” The other girl, presumably Marina, replied. “I’m hungry, and they have food, so I’m going to eat!” She stomped across the hall to where the food was being served, elbowed past the people already in line, and grabbed a plate of food from a shocked mage in an apron.

“They’re going to throw you out of the Trials!” The girl following Marina insisted.

“Well, they can do that after I finish eating,” Marina declared, sitting in an empty spot at the nearest table. Lifting her plate to head level, she began shoveling down its contents, hardly making use of any utensils. The girl with pigtails stood nearby, wringing her hands. About fifteen seconds later, Marina set her empty plate down and banged her fists on the table before standing up, leaving behind her dishes.

“Now then,” Marina said, wiping her mouth on her sleeve, “where were you trying to take me?”

“To get fitted for our robes,” the girl with the pigtails said weakly.

“Great, lead the way.”

With that, the two girls headed towards the doors. As soon as they left, conversation erupted amongst the dining youths.

“What on earth was that all about?” Gale exclaimed.

“Who does she think she is?” Jasper wondered.

“Somebody really h-hungry,” Grover chuckled.

Graff grunted. “Rude girl. Troublemaker.”

Asher and the others went back to eating their food. Such a strange girl. Asher wondered if he would meet her during the trials or if she’d be kicked out before the day was through. He shook his head. He needed to focus on himself not getting kicked out. This first day was going to be brutal, he could feel it.
