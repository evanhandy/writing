“Whatever are we going to do with you, Kassandra?” Kassie’s mom asked, standing with her hands on her hips.

Kassie swung her feet back and forth as she sat on one of the high-backed chairs in Councilman Eaglet’s office, eyes gazing down at the ornate rug on the floor.

“Why did you use magic outside of Eaglet Ward?” Kassie’s father questioned, pacing the floor.

“Because I was not in our small portion of the city when I was in danger,” Kassie said.

“She means, because she was taking a risky shortcut in a dark alley and ran into trouble,” Inspector Hoffman said, standing near the door. He had removed his goggles which now hung around his neck.

“Why ever did you feel the need to hurry home so fast?” Kassie’s mom asked.

“When were you expecting her back?” Inspector Hoffman asked.

“Around ten-fifteen this morning,” Kassie’s dad said, “about ten minutes before you arrived with her in your custody.”

Inspector Hoffman nodded. “That makes sense. I caught her near the train station.”

“The train station?” Kassie’s mom exclaimed. “What on earth were you doing there?”

“I wasn’t in the station,” Kassie lied, “I was at Mr. Pinch’s Grocery.”

“But that’s so much farther away than the local market,” Kassie’s father pointed out, “and more expensive too.”

“It’s nice not having to browse and haggle with all the different vendors,” Kassie fibbed.

“I wasn’t going to say anything,” Inspector Hoffman interrupted, “but I almost apprehended you in the station, Kassie.”

The color drained from Kassie’s face as she looked up at Inspector Hoffman, trying and failing to maintain an innocent expression.

“You know the law,” the detective said simply. “No minors in the magical wards are allowed to travel via the train system.”

“I wasn’t going to get on a train,” Kassie muttered.

“Which is why I didn’t cause a scene,” Inspector Hoffman said.

Kassie’s father rubbed a hand over his face. “This is about George, isn’t it?”

Kassie didn’t respond.

“We’ve told you, he isn’t your brother anymore,” Kassie’s father said, his tone raising. “He abandoned all that matters and left us. For what? To slave every day in a hot tin can.”

“Being a train engineer is a respectable profession,” Inspector Hoffman said.

“You stay out of this, Inspector!” Kassie’s father said, pointing a shaking finger at the man. “Your kind is even worse than…”

“That’s enough, Mr. Nightshade,” Councilman Eaglet said, speaking up for the first time from behind his dark wooden desk. “I think I see what’s going on here. Thank you, inspector. You may leave.”

Inspector Hoffman nodded toward Councilman Eaglet, tipped his hat toward Kassie’s father, and exited the room.

A few quiet moments passed, Kassie’s gaze once more directed toward the floor.

“Now,” Councilman Eaglet said, breaking the silence, “let’s try to talk this out civilly. Mr. and Mrs. Nightshade, I understand why you don’t want your daughter associating with your disowned son.”

“He would corrupt her with his modernistic views of the world,” Kassie’s father said, throwing his hands in the air.

“We don’t want Kassie to forsake the old ways like her brother did,” Kassie’s mom added.

“Nor do I,” Councilman Eaglet said. “It is important that our knowledge, practices, and way of living continue on through the generations, despite the strong opposition we face.”

“You know I’m right here,” Kassie put in.

“You’re our future, Kassie,” Kassie’s mom said, walking over and stroking Kassie’s head. “With George gone, who else will carry on our heritage?”

“We can’t have you running off like this,” Kassie’s father said. “Goodness, perhaps we should keep you from leaving the ward altogether.”

“That’s not a bad idea, actually,” Councilman Eaglet said.

All eyes turned toward the councilman.

“Kassie’s what, eleven now?” Councilman Eaglet continued. “In my eyes, she’s old enough for us to begin giving her a proper tutelage. I’m thinking of getting someone from Aurora Ward.”

“From Central District?” Kassie’s mom gasped.

Councilman Eaglet nodded. “It would require a few strings being pulled, but I believe I can get one of the very best tutors in the city, if that’s what it takes to solidify Kassie’s roots in our magical society.”

“Wow, it’s… it’s an honor, sir,” Kassie’s father said.

Kassie looked toward Councilman Eaglet with her mouth open. A tutor from Aurora Ward?

“There is a condition though,” Councilman Eaglet said. “Young Kassie will be forbidden to leave Eaglet Ward until she completes her tutoring.”

“How long is that?” Kassie asked timidly. “A few weeks? A month?”

“You’ll probably be finished by the time you’re sixteen, Kassie,” the councilman said.

Kassie about fell out of her chair. “Five years?”

“Give or take a few months, yes.”

Kassie’s parents looked at each other.

“It’s probably for the best,” Kassie’s mom said.

“And it would get her away from the influence of the industrial world,” Kassie’s father agreed.

Kassie stared at her parents. Did they really think this was a good idea?

“Then it’s settled,” Councilman Eaglet said, slapping the arms of his chair. “I’ll make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, I suggest you keep a close eye on Kassie.”

Kassie’s father nodded. “I’ll make sure her door and window are warded for the rest of the day.”

“Good idea,” Councilman Eaglet said.

“You’re going to lock me in my room with magic?” Kassie cried out.

“It’s for your own good,” Kassie’s father said. “And for the good of our community.”

“You’ll thank us later,” Kassie’s mom promised.

Kassie sat back in her chair, dumbfounded. How could her parents do this to her? She thought they loved her. Then again, she thought they had loved George once, too. Her parents and Councilman Eaglet continued talking, but Kassie didn’t hear them. What was to become of her, enclosed in their tiny little ward for five years? Who knows where George could be after all that time?

Kassie’s parents started to leave, and Kassie got up and followed them, sullenly. She walked with them out of the stone courthouse and into the central square. Children a few years younger than Kassie played with an empty soup can in the square, kicking it back and forth. Kassie watched them longingly. If only she was able to be so carefree.

Kassie frowned. She wouldn’t be staying home with a tutor. She would run away, find her brother, and figure out why he left. He would let her talk to him if she got the chance, she just knew it. The only question now, was when and how she was going to leave. She nodded to herself. Tonight. Using magic.
