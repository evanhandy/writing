Kassie wandered aimlessly through the city streets. There weren’t that many people out, but the streets were still lit by the light posts placed at regular intervals. Kassie didn’t know where to go. She didn’t dare go near the train station, that’s where the inspectors would first look for her. She needed to find an isolated location, somewhere where the law wouldn’t expect her to be. She turned around in a circle. She didn’t know the city well outside of her ward besides the areas near the market and the train station. Biting her lip, she picked a random street and walked quickly down it.
