“Do you see it?”

Asher looked up from the book he was reading. “See what?”

“There,” his father said, pointing. “Beyond those two hills.”

Asher sat up on the wooden bench of the bouncing wagon and peered in the direction his father had indicated. On the horizon, tinted blue by the distance, a great tree stood.

“Is that…”

“The Mother Tree,” his father said.

“But it’s only been a day since we left town!”

“And another three days before we arrive. Well, what do you think? Is it as impressive as those books of yours make it out to be?”

“It’s as tall as a mountain!”

Asher’s father laughed. “I responded in about the same way when I first saw it, many years ago. I’ve never been much closer than this, however. I’m excited to finally see it up close.”

The tree began to drift out of view as they descended into a valley. Asher watched it until it disappeared completely from sight.

“Wow,” Asher said, settling back into his seat, “I knew the Mother Tree was big, but actually seeing it was something else.”

“And it seemed you enjoyed your conversation with the head tree keeper yesterday as well. Reading books can’t quite substitute for meeting real people or seeing real things.”

“I’m glad for books,” Asher said. “They allow me to experience so much more than I possibly could on my own. How else could I be able to see the floating cities of the Air Province, or know what it was like to live in the days of old, when the Mother Tree was young?”

“Or participate in the Ascension Trials, yet here you are.”

“I never imagined I would be attempting the Trials,” Asher conceded, “even if it’s only going to be for a few months.”

The next few hours passed in silence except for the call of birds, the rustle of woodland creatures, the clip-clop of the horse, and the rattle of the wagon. They passed forests and clearings, until eventually they came across another town.

“What’s this?” Asher’s father said, pulling the wagon to a stop. The main street was blocked off, a large procession of people solemnly walking through the town, all dressed in black and quietly chanting a hymn.

“A funeral?” Asher guessed.

“Too big for a normal funeral. Even an important person wouldn’t draw the whole town like this.” Asher’s father rubbed his chin. “Maybe…”

“What?”

“Well, last I knew, this town had a resident mage. He was old, and people were wondering when he would pass on. What timing that it would happen while we were passing through.”

“So, this is a funeral for a mage?” Asher said, perking up.

“I’m assuming you’ve read about these.”

“When a mage dies and is buried,” Asher recited, “the seed from the Mother Tree that has been inside him since he first became a mage sprouts and becomes a new mage tree.”

“Aye,” Asher’s father sighed. “And I’ll bet my horse that these people are about as excited for the tree as they are sad at his passing. More trees mean more talismans, and the city prospers.”

“You don’t seem happy about it,” Asher said.

“It’s just morbid, that’s all.” Asher’s father looked around. “I think I can get us around using the side streets.”

He turned the cart and guided the horse down an alternate path through the buildings. The side roads weren’t as wide as the main street but were still clear of snow and large enough to comfortably accommodate the wagon. Asher caught glimpses of the procession between the structures as they passed. Near the front, separated from the rest of the crowd was a small group of people, six of them carrying an open casket.

“That must be the mage’s children and their families,” Asher commented.

Asher’s father didn’t look. “Makes sense. Those are the ones who will care for the tree. Them and their descendants until the end of time or the end of trees.”

“Why doesn’t our family care for the tree in the market plaza? Aren’t we descended from that mage?”

Asher’s father didn’t answer at first. “Probably best to be quiet for now, don’t want to disturb the townsfolk.”

Asher could sense that his father was dodging the question but decided not to press the issue. The rest of their journey through the town was somber, the air filled with the calm singing of the funeral procession.
