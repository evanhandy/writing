The sun was starting to set outside by the time Asher and his friends finished their third exam. According to the clock, it was almost five o’clock.

“Great job, everyone,” Ms. Wyndham said. “If you would please leave your booklets and your cards from the outdoor trials on your tables, you may all go to dinner.”

Many applicants gave sighs of relief, and Asher and his friends got up to leave.

“So many tests,” Gale said, “I have half a mind to follow that guy out of the trials.”

“I’m sure it may be intimidating to some,” Jasper sneered, “but I’m used to this sort of thing.”

“Care to share any of your vast test taking experience with us?” Ray asked.

Jasper sniffed. “I suppose I can tell you some of the basic techniques.”

“The multiple choice questions were easiest for me,” Grover said. “It’s those fill in the b-blanks that really got me.”

Asher noticed that Graff seemed even more silent than he had been throughout the day. Occasionally the thick boy would look towards Asher as if he were about to ask something, then he would turn away.

“Well, one way or another,” Ray said, “I think we made it through the first day.”

“Thank the trees,” Gale said.

The boys ate dinner and then headed back to their room. With some time on their hands, they settled in their belongings and made themselves more comfortable. Asher claimed half of a desk for his books before climbing up into his bunk and laying there. It was dark outside, but the light from the fire talisman kept their room bright.

“Do you think tomorrow will be as involved as today?” Gale asked.

“Probably more so,” Ray said.

“I wonder how hard it is to become a mage.”

“You h-heard Mr. Seedwood,” Grover said. “Before we entered the domain of the Mother Tree last night he said there was only twelve out of over two-th-thousand that graduated and became mages.”

Asher’s mind automatically did the calculation. “That’s about half of a percent.”

“Those sound like awful odds,” Gale said. “Also, you did that math in your head?”

“It’s not that difficult,” Asher said. “Twelve divided by two is six. Move the decimal over three times and you get point zero zero six. There were over two-thousand applicants, so the odds are a little less than that. It’s a fair approximation.”

“That’s freaky.”

Asher blushed and didn’t respond.

“Asher,” Graff said after a few minutes of silence.

“Yeah?” Asher said.

There was a pause. “Never mind.”

The boys spent the next few hours chatting about the day’s activities and their homelands. Eventually, the lights dimmed, and everyone went to bed. Asher couldn’t help but feel a mixture of relief and astonishment. He had made it through the first day of the Ascension Trials, and one day closer to lightening the burden on his family.
