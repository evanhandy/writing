Sundown was already dark in the deep forest, but that night it seemed more foreboding than usual. A murmur of activity rustled amongst the leshies as they gathered at the edge of the Faerie Ring. News traveled fast in the wood. Twinkling lights danced around the more magically inclined of the forest folk, while others held tiny lanterns on the end of staves to ward off the gloom.

Fully adorned in his scale mail tunic and with his sword and shield equipped, Axil jogged to the edge of the ring. Leshies made room for the wannabe adventurer, whispering amongst themselves. Looking around for his friend, Axil eventually saw Wort coming slowly alongside the stream that ran along the center of their village, waddling on his stubby legs.

“Come on,” Axil called out. “Can you go any slower?”

“There’s no need to hurry,” Wort replied. “All in good time.”

“I can’t imagine him on an adventure,” Frumple said, stepping up beside Axil. “You I can understand, but him?”

“He can go faster if he wanted to,” Axil said. “I’m sure he could handle the overland travel.”

“If you say so.”

With Wort’s arrival at the Faerie Ring, Frumple circled around to stand outside the ring on the opposite side from which Axil and Wort were standing.

“Axil Sprout,” Frumple began, “earlier today I offered you a challenge, which you accepted. Do you still wish to duel?”

“I am a leshy of my word,” Axil replied. “I intend to see this through.”

“Then under the authorization from the Great Tree,” Frumple said in a loud voice, “I call upon the fey spirits to protect us from lasting harm while within the Faerie Ring.”

The mushrooms that formed the Faerie Ring lit up with a magical light, and softly glowing motes of green drifted in the air within the circle.

Frumple looked at Axil again. “Are you ready?”

Axil drew his sword and shield and looked at Wort, who nodded. “We are,” Axil said.

Frumple stepped into the ring, his body attracting the motes of light which gave him a green glow. “Then let us begin.”

Axil and Wort stepped into the Faerie Circle. As soon as they were both inside, Frumple reached up into his mushroom-cap head and pulled out a spore pod. Lobbing it at Axil, the spore pod burst in a cloudy explosion. Axil coughed, and as he looked up again, another one hit him squarely in the face, the impact nearly causing him to fall backwards.

Shaking off the dust, Axil charged in with his sword and slashed at Frumple. The blow struck hard, though the fey spirits’ protection prevented the blade from sinking into Frumple’s flesh. Axil raised his shield as Frumple swung his arm back to strike. Before he could swing at Axil, three darts of force blasted into Frumple. Axil looked back briefly to see Wort, staff held high in one hand while he gestured with the other.

“Nice one, Wort!” a leshy called out from the crowd. “Get ‘im, Axil!”

Axil turned back just in time to receive a blow from Frumple. Axil’s knees threatened to buckle, and the veteran fungus swung again, but Axil’s shield deflected the attack at the last moment. Seeing an opening, Axil summoned the last of his strength and brought his sword down on Frumple. The force of the swing staggered the experienced warrior, causing him to fall to one knee.

“Enough,” Frumple panted. Axil backed away, sword lowered. The leshies gathered around the Faerie Circle broke out into cheers and applause.

Frumple pushed himself up, the glowing motes of light clustering at the impact marks from Axil and Wort’s attacks. Axil noticed that the motes were also hovering around his own wounds, and the pain from them ebbed away.

Frumple caught his breath. “Well done.”

Wort trundled up to Axil and smiled at him. Axil sheathed his sword and stowed his shield. “Will you let us go now, Frumple?”

The grizzled leshy nodded. “I will not stop you. You seem adequately prepared for the perils that lie ahead of you, even though I believe you do not comprehend them.”

“You left the forest, once,” Wort said. “What did you encounter?”

Frumple said nothing for a moment. “I wish not to burden these verdant lands with those tales. Just know that you won’t even have to leave the forest proper before you start running into trouble.” He gestured towards Axil’s scabbard. “Keep that sword of yours sharp, Axil. And you, Wort, lend support to Axil as best you can. Both of you, please survive and come back someday.” Axil thought he almost saw tears in Frumple’s eyes.

Axil stood as tall as he could. “You have my word.”

The warrior leshy looked at Axil intently. “May you come to learn how hard it can be to keep one’s word.” With that, he turned to leave. Seeming to remember something, he looked back at the two friends. “Swing by my place on your way out tomorrow morning, I have something to give you.” He walked off.

With Frumple gone, the leshy crowd took that as their cue to swarm the duo, slapping them on the back and giving them their congratulations on a battle well fought. Axil thanked them modestly, while Wort just smiled and scratched behind his head, bobbing in appreciation. Axil felt as if he were on top of those mountains already.
