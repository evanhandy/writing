“Well,” Grover said, “we survived that t-t-trial.”

Ray reshuffled the playing cards after the end of another round. “Sorry I held you all up,” he said, dealing out the cards, “I’ve been having troubles keeping my talismans active for extended periods of time.”

“It’s all good,” Gale said, accepting his hand of cards. “It’s not like we’re in a race or anything.”

“Such power,” Jasper muttered, “how did he manage to draw so much out of such a small piece of mage wood? He must be of noble birth.”

“Why would that matter?” Graff asked.

“I wasn’t talking to you, sheepherder.”

“Come on, Jasper,” Ray said, “don’t be like that. He has a name. Use it.”

Jasper gave Ray a look, then sighed. “My apologies, Graff. If you must know, nobility has a greater aptitude for magic.”

Asher started coughing. In what world? Then he thought about it.

“That’s just an opinion, right?” Gale questioned.

“Actually,” Asher said, “he may have a point. The upper class would have more access to talismans than most poorer communities, so they would have greater exposure to and practice with magic. That would make anyone better at using talismans.”

Jasper blinked. “Did you read that in one of your books?”

“No,” Asher said, “it just makes sense.”

“K-k-kinda puts us commoners at a disadvantage, then,” Grover said.

“We’re in the Ascension Trials,” Ray said. “There’s no discrimination based on class or upbringing here. It’s all about natural talent and learning capability. By the end of the first month, I bet you couldn’t even tell the difference between a noble and a peasant.”

Jasper looked like he wanted to argue, but he kept his mouth shut.

A girl’s scream sounded from up ahead. Everyone looked towards the source of the noise. A tall, wooden structure dominated a major portion of the field dedicated to the next trial, and flying high above it was a lone girl, crying out and desperately flailing her arms and legs as she sailed upward.

Mages started to move into action, but none of them were as quick as Skyler. Several places ahead of Asher and his friends, he jumped out of line and dashed to where the next box of talismans was kept. Reaching into the crate, he slipped a wooden disc into each of his gloves before launching himself into the air with a burst of wind, arms stretched out behind him. Swift as an arrow, he shot straight through the sky towards the frantic girl. The girl reached the apex of her trajectory and began falling. Asher held his breath. Was Skyler really trying to catch her? Would he make it?

A moment before the girl hit the roof of the wooden tower, Skyler snatched her out of the air, carrying her in his arms. Cheers erupted among the youths and mages. Skyler slowed down and made a gentle descent, landing smoothly at the bottom of the wooden structure and depositing the girl safely on her feet.

Mages gathered around, some clapping Skyler on the back and congratulating him. Other mages saw to the girl, helping her to one of the chairs that stood next to the small desks near the wooden tower. One mage ran off and soon came back with a glass of water for the girl. Youths and mages at the top of the tower yelled and clapped their hands while those in line all shifted, trying to get a better look at the hero of the hour.

“My g-g-goodness,” Grover said, holding a hand to his chest. “For a second, I thought he wasn’t going to catch her.”

“He has to be a noble,” Jasper insisted, “he has to be.”

“How did she even manage to get up there?” Gale wondered.

“Same way he did, I imagine,” Ray said, “except without any of the control.”

“Right, I know,” Gale agreed, “but like, how? Flight is a very deliberate technique.”

“Maybe we’ll understand better once we get a closer look at that test they’re doing with the tower,” Asher suggested, “though I think we can all agree that the next element is air.”

“Amen,” Ray said, gathering up the playing cards again. “What do you all say, one more round before the trial?”

“I’m good,” Gale said. “I have plenty to think about for now.”

Everyone else expressed similar opinions.

Ray nodded, putting the cards back in his pocket. “I’m guessing this trial has to do with flight.”

“That’s kinda advanced for a beginner’s trial,” Gale said, “I wonder how they plan on implementing it.”

“I g-g-guess we’ll see in a moment,” Grover said.
