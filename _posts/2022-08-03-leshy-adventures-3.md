The next morning, Axil and Wort knocked on Frumple’s door. The veteran leshy opened it and looked at the two friends.

“Ready to leave?” Frumple asked.

Axil nodded. On his back was a pack with adventuring gear. Wort patted a satchel that was slung across one shoulder.

Frumple grunted. “Good. You’ll need more than your wits out there in the wide world. Here, take these.” He handed Axil and Wort a small pouch each.

“Why, these are gold pieces!” Axil exclaimed, looking into his pouch.

“Don’t spend it all in one place, and be careful who you show those to. There are lots of people that would happily dispose of you to take your money.”

“Noted,” Axil said, putting the coin pouch away. “Any other tips for the road?”

“You’ll meet a lot of big folk out there,” Frumple said. “They’ll underestimate you, which for the most part means you’ll be able to enter most towns and cities without issue.”

Axil’s thoughts drifted off. Towns? Cities? All he had known was his small village. What great civilizations awaited their discovery out there?

“Another thing,” Frumple continued, bringing Axil back to the present. “Remember to rely on each other. Going it alone, or worse, leaving your companion behind is a sure way to get one or both of you killed. Sure, scouting ahead a little on your own is fine, but just because you’re good with a sword, don’t think that you can take on every challenge yourself.”

Axil realized that Frumple was mainly talking to him. “I won’t leave Wort behind,” Axil said. “He is my best friend.”

Frumple grunted. “The open road will test that friendship, and either break you or build you up stronger than ever before.”

“I tend to bend more easily than I break,” Axil said. “We’ll conquer the open road, and then the mountains. And once we achieved our goal, we’ll return here, safe and sound.”

Frumple looked somber. “May that be the case.” He turned away. “Go, begin your journey. I’ll be here, waiting.”

Axil nodded. “We’ll be back.” He turned and looked at his friend. “Come on, Wort. Let’s go.”
