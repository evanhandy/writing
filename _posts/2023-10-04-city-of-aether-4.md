A knock on Lucas’s door woke him up. He blinked his eyes, looking up at his ceiling. Then he bolted upright. His forge. He hurried up the ladder and checked on the embers. Thankfully, they had stayed inside the forge. Breathing a sigh of relief, Lucas doused the smoldering coals with water.

The knock at his door sounded again, louder this time.

“Coming!” Lucas called, sliding back down the ladder. He opened the door. It was Diana Bluit.

“Good morning, Diana,” Lucas said, rubbing his eyes.

The lean woman bent down and tapped Lucas’s head. “Good morning? It’s past five in the afternoon, you sleepyhead!”

Lucas stopped rubbing his eyes. “Already?”

“Yes, already,” Diana said, “what were you doing, sleeping in the middle of the day?”

“Didn’t mean to take a nap,” Lucas yawned. “Perhaps I stayed up too late last night again.”

Diana stood back up to her full height and clicked her tongue. “Maybe this is what parents are there for, to train their kids on proper sleeping schedules.”

“Don’t need ‘em,” Lucas said, stretching. “I still get done what needs to be done during the day.”

“Well, I’m here to add another item to the ‘needs to be done’ list.”

“Another leaky pipe?”

Diana nodded. “Time to earn your stay.”

“Let me grab my tools.”

“Better grab your big wrenches,” Diana advised as Lucas retreated into his house, “this one’s a doozy.”
