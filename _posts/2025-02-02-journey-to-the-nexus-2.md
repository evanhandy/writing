By the time Typhan, Della, and Alam reached the village, Alam was looking a lot better. His dark, leather clothes and matching boots and gloves covered most of his skin, but his bare head was a mix of volcanic rock and blue magma, and he overall seemed much more alive than when he was in the watercliff.

The village was mostly awake, the sun now fully risen and shining down on the mud huts. A handful of Muddan and Aqualic villagers were bustling about, carrying baskets or talking to neighbors. Most of them stopped what they were doing when they saw Alam. Looking behind, Typhan noticed that they were attracting a following of curious onlookers. He took a deep breath and faced forward again. Hopefully he and Della could pass Alam off to the village elders and have him be their problem.

They soon reached the village square, and Typhan pulled back the entry curtain to the elders’ council hut and motioned for Alam to enter. The blue Magmari hesitated.

“How long has it been since you’ve had visitors from outside your valley?” he asked.

“Three or four months,” Della answered. “Why?”

“No reason,” Alam said, and he ducked into the hut.

Typhan shared a glance with Della. There was something going on with this Magmari. Maybe the elders would see through him.

The interior of the hut was hazy with mud leaf smoke. The three elders sat on cushions around a small fire. Three empty cushions rested opposite them towards the entrance.

“Welcome, Della, Typhan,” the middle elder said, a Muddan of many years. His face was a mess of droopy wrinkles that made it hard to see his eyes.

“Please, have a seat,” an old yet beautiful Aqualic woman sitting on the Muddan elder’s left said, her watery hair flowing gently around her shoulders.

The broad-shouldered Terran man on the Muddan elder’s right said nothing as Typhan and Della took seats on the empty cushions around the fire, Typhan on the right and Della on the left. Alam remained standing.

“You seem surprisingly prepared for our sudden meeting,” he said, his eyes shifting between the elders.

“Word travels fast, and our village is small,” the Muddan elder croaked. He gestured towards the seat between Della and Typhan. “Please, make yourself comfortable.”

Alam glanced at Typhan and Della, then walked to the cushion and sat down.

“Now then,” the Muddan elder said, “how about you three tell us what happened this morning?”

Typhan and Della told the elders about how they found and rescued Alam.

“And what about you, Magmari?” the Terran elder asked, speaking up for the first time, his thick rocky arms folded. “How did you come to our valley?”

Alam lifted his chin. “My story isn’t important. All I ask for is a few days refuge here and then some transport to the mudland coast.”

“Headed for the lavalands, are you?” the Muddan elder mused.

“You can make that assumption,” Alam said.

“Well, assumption or not, we need to know how you got here and why,” the Aqualic woman said. “Our village is peaceful and well hidden. We don’t want to attract any unsavory visitors.”

“I wasn’t being followed,” Alam said.

“Then why the need to lay low?” she challenged. “We could speed you on your way today, why wait?”

Alam shifted in his seat and didn’t say anything.

The Aqualic woman turned her gaze towards Typhan. “You said there wasn’t any sign of a boat?”

Typhan nodded. “We didn’t see any, but it could have drifted away from the edge of the watercliff.”

“I was trying to get some water,” Alam spoke up. “I leaned out of my boat and fell into the sea. I wore myself out trying to stay afloat. You should know most Magmari can’t swim, and I’m no exception. The last thing I remember before everything went dark was sinking through the water.”

The Muddan elder nodded. “The Clearwater Sea is fresh water, and even Magmari need to drink.”

“But that still doesn’t explain why he needs to stay,” the Terran man pointed out. “He’s avoiding the issue.” He glared at Alam. “Cut to the point, son.”

Typhan saw Alam grit his teeth, his magma glowing more fiercely.

“I—”

Alam was cut off by a icy wind sweeping into the hut, extinguishing the fire. The Terran man was on his feet in a flash, the Aqualic woman standing up almost as fast.

“What have you brought upon us, boy?” the Aqualic woman demanded, striding past Alam and towards the door.

“No, don’t go outside!” Alam cried out as he, Typhan, and Della also scrambled to their feet. “He’s not—”

A second frozen gust tore through the entrance of the hut, freezing the Aqualic woman solid and icing the exposed parts of Typhan’s skin.

“River!” the Terran man yelled, rushing towards the Aqualic woman.

Typhan looked on with wide eyes. She was turned into a sculpture in an instant. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Alam slowly backing further into the hut. The Terran man turned and grabbed him roughly by the arm.

“You know who’s out there,” the Terran man accused. “Tell me, will there be any more ice winds?”

“Only if you provoke him,” Alam murmured.

“You’ll answer for this,” the Terran man breathed, and he drug Alam outside.

Typhan found he could move, the icy layer of his skin cracking. It was so cold. He looked towards Della. Half her body was frosted with white ice, but she seemed to be able to move as well.

“Go, you two,” the Muddan elder said from his seat. He appeared to be relatively unaffected by the blast. Perhaps he was far enough away from the entryway? “You’ll be in more danger if you’re associated with the elders and that boy.” He pointed a finger towards a curtain in the back. “There’s another exit that way. Hurry, before you’re spotted in here.”

Taking one last glance towards the frozen Aqualic woman, Typhan turned and ran towards the back, Della hobbling behind him. Ducking through the curtain, Typhan found himself in a small living space, with a stove, pots, and a sleeping mat. Light shone through another curtain on the right side of the room, and Typhan hurried through.

Stepping outside, he stopped. A wholly unfamiliar sight met his eyes. The village was white and still, the plants, huts, ground, and even people frozen in place under a thick coating of ice. Della came behind him and gasped. Typhan looked towards his family’s hut. His father and mother stood outside, statues.

A loud grinding sound tore his attention away from the widespread tragedy. It came from the water tree grove. The tops of the watercliffs in that direction were barely visible, and what he could see was clearly frozen solid. Some horrible contraption with a dizzying array of spiked wheels was descending the cliff. It soon dropped below the tree line, and Typhan ran towards his parents.

“Typhan, wait!” Della called out.

Typhan looked back. Half of the Muddan girl was still iced over.

“My feet are freezing to the ground,” she said. “I can’t move!”

Typhan looked between her and his parents. With the distant grinding coming ever closer, he made up his mind and hurried back to Della. Sure enough, her bare, mud feet had frozen to the icy ground.

“Can you lift your feet at all?” Typhan asked.

Della looked at him with panicked eyes. “The bottoms of my feet will tear off. Help me, Typhan!”

Typhan bit his lip. What could he do? He looked around at the surrounding village. What magic could have done this? It was ice, but he’d never heard of Glacians with this much power.

An idea came to him, and he unsheathed his pruning knife and bent near Della’s feet.

“What are you doing?” she asked, her voice near hysteria.

“Calm down,” Typhan grunted. Gripping the knife with the point downwards, he started chipping away at the ice around Della’s feet. After a dozen or so picks, part of the icy road came up with Della’s foot, frozen together. Shifting position, Typhan worked quickly on the other foot. Soon, she could lift both feet.

“Lean on me,” Typhan said. “Let’s get somewhere safe.” He looked around at the frozen landscape. “If somewhere safe still exists.”

They hobbled together down the frozen street, their breath coming out in plumes. The grinding noise kept getting louder. Typhan noticed the Terran elder still with Alam in his grip, looking towards the oncoming noise. A cloud of sparkling ice particles was visible as the loud machine came over the bend, its bladed wheels tearing up everything in its path. Typhan and Della moved to hide behind a hut, even as the Terran elder strode towards the machine, Alam in tow. The massive spiked machine was nearing the crowded street of villagers.

“Is this who you’re after?” the large Terran man yelled, hoisting Alam up by his upper arm. “We’ll give him to you. Leave our village alone.”

With a loud screech of metal on metal, the vehicle ground to a stop, mere inches away from the first of the frozen villagers. The machine rested, hissing and clanging. Typhan held his breath. What would happen next?

A white metal compartment atop the spiked wheels opened, and a wide, icy staircase shot to the ground. A tall Glacian man in regal white robes stepped out of the compartment and walked gracefully down the stairs.

“Ah, Alam,” the man said, his voice light and airy. “The stray sheep. My lost brother. How good it is to have found you at last.” He looked towards the Terran elder and made a patting gesture. “Please, set him down.”

“I don’t know who you are,” the Terran elder said, still holding Alam aloft, “but I must ask that you reverse your magic on our valley.”

The Glacian man cocked his head. “Reverse? I’m sorry, I’m afraid that’s just not possible. I’m sure the sun will thaw everything out eventually, though goodness knows how much of it will still be alive. I’ve never stuck around long enough in a place I’ve frozen over to see how things resolved. Now set my brother down, before I get angry.”

The Terran elder slowly lowered Alam to the ground but kept a hold of his arm.

“That’s better,” the Glacian man said. He extended a hand towards Alam. “Come, your chariot awaits.”

Alam spat an bubbling glop of blue magma at the Glacian man, only for it to freeze solid before hitting him. The Glacian smiled, casually dusting off his robes where the frozen stone had landed.

“Tell me, Alam,” he said. “Do you like this Terran man?”

Typhan could see Alam glance towards the Terran elder. “Not particularly, especially when he’s manhandling me.”

The Glacian nodded and inhaled deeply.

“Look out!” Alam yelled.

Typhan and Della ducked further behind the hut just as the Glacian exhaled a blistering gust of wind that shot through the valley, adding another layer of ice to everything.

Peeking back around, Typhan saw the Terran man, completely iced over. His hand still held Alam. The blue Magmari’s clothes were covered in ice, but his glowing head remained unaffected.

“Remember, brother,” the Glacian man said gently, striding across the frozen ground towards him, “side with your father, and you’ll always be able to get rid of the things you don’t like.” He touched the Terran elder, and he crumbled into chunks of ice.

“You’re insane, Milas,” Alam hissed. Steam started rising from the ice covering his body. After a moment, the ice broke off him. “I’d rather die than become one of father’s pawns like you.”

Milas put on a sad face. “You know we can’t have that, you’re far too special.” He looked around. “However, if you’d like, I can kill everyone else here. I was serious about not knowing if they’d survive my ice breath, but I can always make sure.”

“No!” Alam exclaimed. “I’ll go. Just make sure to back out the way you came, I’ll become difficult if you crush anyone with your machine.”

“There we go,” Milas said, his smile returning. “Shall we go, then?”

Alam stiffly started walking up the ice stairs into the compartment of the machine, Milas close behind.

“What do we do?” Della whispered.

“We don’t do anything,” Typhan muttered back. “If we try something, we both die.”

They watched as Alam and Milas entered the massive vehicle. With a clanging of metal and grinding of ice, it slowly backed away from the village before turning and rumbling in the direction of the water grove.

After it passed out of view, Typhan and Della crept out of hiding. Everything was pure white, the sun reflecting brightly off the frozen village. Typhan walked carefully across the frozen dirt road to his parents, his leather boots protecting his feet from freezing to the ground. He looked at his parents. Both were covered in a thick layer of frosted ice, making it impossible to tell their expressions.

He heard Della walking up behind him. “What now?” she breathed. “Everything’s completely iced over.”

Tears welled in Typhan’s eyes. “We make him pay for this.”

Della let out a harsh laugh. “Are you kidding? He can kill you with his breath. How do you stop that?”

“He had to have gotten that power from somewhere,” Typhan said. “If we could do the same…”

Della slapped him across the face, leaving a muddy hand print. “You’d become the thing you hate? Remember the words the elders taught us since we were little; anger leads only to more hurt.”

“The elders are dead!” Typhan cried.

“Not all of us,” the Muddan elder said softly. Typhan whirled around, almost slipping on the ice. The Muddan elder had exited the hut, walking on wooden sandals. He gazed on the scene of devastation.

“I had my suspicions when a blue Magmari appeared,” the Muddan elder murmured. He looked towards Typhan and Della. “Come with me back to the council hut, there is much we need to talk about.”
