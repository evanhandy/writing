Kassie adjusted her gas mask as she walked with Diana and Lucas back towards Hickory Heights, her nose filled with the scent of leather, metal, and her own breath.

“Mask uncomfortable?” Lucas asked.

“It’s so stifling,” Kassie replied, her muffled voice reverberating in her head. “I’m not liking having something on my face.” She peered through her goggles at the busy crowds they were passing through. Occasionally she would see someone else wearing a gas mask, but what she was really looking for were the inspectors.

“They’re definitely uncomfortable at first,” Lucas admitted, “but you’ll get used to it.”

The sound of a train whistle in the distance caught Kassie’s attention. Was her brother on that train?

Lucas was still speaking. “I hope you like your new duds, I missed half a day’s worth of work waiting on you two.”

Kassie looked in the direction of the train station. With her new disguise, could she start looking for her brother again?

“Anyway, if you’re gonna be around for a while, I should show you the project I’ve been working on. It’s…”

“Excuse me,” a deep voice said.

Kassie looked forward again and flinched. Blocking their path in front of them was a tall man in a long, dark gray overcoat wearing a modest top hat. One lens of his goggles was colored an eerie green.

“Can I help you?” Diana asked.

Kassie’s heart pumped. This wasn’t Inspector Hoffman, but he was definitely part of the Bureau. Growing up, Kassie had heard rumors that the Bureau inspectors could see traces of magic through that green lens, including magical people. Was her moment of freedom at an end?

“Is this girl with you?” the man asked, gesturing towards Kassie.

“As a matter of fact, yes,” Diana said, her tone conversational.

“Forgive the intrusion, but I’m going to have to ask her to remove her mask and goggles for a moment.”

Kassie stiffened.

“Hold on,” Diana said, putting her hands on her hips. “Why does she need to do that? Who do you think you are?”

The man straightened. “I am Inspector Peterson. There has been a missing girl report, and this girl here matches the height and hair color description.”

“Can I see a badge?”

“Certainly.” Inspector Peterson reached into his overcoat and pulled out a dark leather wallet. Flipping it open, he showed Diana an official looking emblem. He then pulled out a small picture from inside the wallet. The blood drained from Kassie’s face. It was a picture of her. The Bureau took one of each resident of the magical communities every year.

Diana didn’t seem to react to the picture at all. “Well, I don’t want to get in the way of the long arm of the law, but this girl has sensitive lungs and needs the mask on at all times.”

“I’m afraid I must insist,” Inspector Peterson said, putting the picture back into his wallet and pocketing it. “It’ll only be for a moment.”

Sighing, Diana let her hands drop from her hips. “Fine, then.” She turned away from the inspector and bent down in front of Kassie. “I need you to hold your breath for me, okay?” Diana puffed out her cheeks and gave Kassie a wink.

Kassie blinked. Would puffing out her cheeks help the inspector not recognize her? That green lens would still show that she was magical though. She guessed it was worth a try. Taking a deep breath, Kassie filled her mouth with air and slowly removed her gas mask.

“The goggles too, please,” the inspector said.

Kassie lifted the goggles off of her eyes and up onto her forehead. Inspector Peterson leaned over and looked her in the eye. She felt a bead of sweat slide down the side of her face as the inspector scrutinized her for several agonizing moments. Finally, he stood up straight.

“You can put that mask back on, young miss,” he said. He turned towards Diana. “I apologize for the confusion. She looks similar to the missing girl, but has some distinct differences. Now, if you’ll excuse me.” He tipped his hat and walked away, quickly disappearing into the crowd.

Kassie stood there with her mouth still full of air, stunned. He didn’t recognize her face? Did the puffed cheeks really do the trick? But what about her magic? Then it dawned on her. Her magic. It was all drained. Had she escaped detection because she overextended herself the night before?

“Come,” Diana said softly to Kassie and Lucas. “We’ll talk more back at my place.”
