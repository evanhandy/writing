Mark walked outside his apartment to tend to his humble flower garden, watering can in hand, only to find Skyla already there. The tiny feminine form was leaning into the petals of a bright yellow flower, reaching deeper inside.

“What are you doing in my flowers, Skyla?” Mark asked.

“Looking for treasure,” she said, bending farther in.

“No, what are you really doing,” Mark asked.

“I already told you!” Skyla said, extracting herself from the flower. Yellow pollen dusted her face and black hair. “I’m looking for treasure.”

“What kind of treasure do you expect to find in a daffodil?”

“Oh, you know,” Skyla said, leaning into the flower again, “diamonds, rubies, pearls, the good stuff.”

“Uh, huh.”

“Not in this one, though,” Skyla said, popping her head up and hovering to another vibrant flower, “that flower had already been raided.”

“Sure,” Mark said, “I bet you won’t find anything more than some allergies.”

Skyla bent over into the flower, legs kicking as she rummaged inside. She gave a little cry of excitement and backed out just enough to look at Mark.

“How much do you wanna bet?” she asked, grinning.

“You didn’t,” Mark said.

Straining under the weight, Skyla pulled herself out of the flower, holding a massive emerald almost the size of herself in both arms.

“Finders, keepers!” she laughed, disappearing with the gem into thin air before Mark could react.

Mark spent the rest of that afternoon squatting down, peering into his flowers.
