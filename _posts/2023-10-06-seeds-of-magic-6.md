“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” A thunderous voice boomed, making Asher jolt awake. “BOYS AND GIRLS!”

The scattered conversations of the crowd quieted down, and Asher stood up, trying to locate the source of the supernaturally loud noise. It seemed to be coming from the direction of the Mother Tree.

“THE TIME IS UPON US. IN ONE SHORT HOUR, THE GATES WILL OPEN, AND THE ASCENSION TRIALS WILL BEGIN! ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST NOW SAY THEIR GOODBYES AND GATHER IN FRONT OF THE GATES.”

“Well that probably woke up everybody in the capital,” Asher’s father murmured, rubbing his eyes.

“MAKE SURE TO BRING YOUR CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH TO THE GATES OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER.”

“That would be the proof of age,” Asher’s father said, rummaging around in his bag, “though I don’t understand the strictness of it.”

“Some authors say it’s because the safest age to become a mage is twelve, and so with the year of testing, they start at eleven.”

Asher’s father handed Asher a piece of paper with some fancy writing and a stamp on it. “Safest? I wasn’t aware that there was physical risk to becoming a mage.”

Asher accepted the copy of his birth certificate and put it into his satchel along with his notebook and his favorite books that he had brought along for the journey. “Apparently there is a chance that the merging of seed and human can fail. There haven’t been any cases in centuries though, most likely because of the formation of the Ascension Trials.”

“Never thought about why they had the Trials,” Asher’s father said. “I expect the story goes longer than we have time for.” He grabbed Asher by the shoulders and looked him up and down by the light of the Mother Tree’s leaves. “You good?”

“All set,” Asher said.

Asher’s father hugged him. “Take care, son.”

“See you in a few months,” Asher said, hugging him back.

Ending the embrace, Asher straightened the strap of his satchel and headed in the direction of the Mother Tree. He looked back one last time and waved goodbye before stepping out of the relative seclusion of their campfire and into the crowds of youths headed for the gates.
