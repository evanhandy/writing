The sun rose high over the dry fields, the short stalks brown and wilted. Asher’s father shook his head.

“That was the last of our seeds,” he muttered. “Don’t know what we’re going to do now.”

Asher watched as his father turned back towards the house. Taking one last look at the disaster that lay before him, the slight wind ruffling his brown hair, Asher followed.

That night the family held a council. Asher, his parents, and his older brother Bud all sat around the kitchen table. Several oil burning lamps lit the room, casting light on the stove, counter-top, and the few simple paintings that hung on the whitewashed walls. From the living-room, the old clock could be heard ticking away the passing seconds.

“How much food do we have left in storage?” Asher’s father asked, burly forearms resting on the wooden table.

“Not much,” Asher’s mother replied. “We used most of it when last year’s crop failed.”

“Enough to make it through the winter?”

“No.”

"What if we borrowed some seeds from our neighbors?” Bud suggested. “We could use fire talismans to keep the ground warm through the winter.”

Asher looked at Bud. He wasn’t as broad as his father, but he was tall and strong, his hands calloused from hard labor.

Asher’s father shook his head. “We can’t cover enough ground with the few talismans we have, and even if we did there aren’t enough of us to keep a sufficient number of them activated both day and night. Besides, I don’t think our neighbors are faring much better than us in this famine. I doubt they have seeds to spare.”

“We can’t just starve to death!” Bud protested, standing up and slamming his hands on the table.

“We’re not going to starve,” Asher’s mother said, looking towards her husband. “We will work it out. Right dear?”

A heavy silence fell on the room. Bud still stood, hands pressed against the table. Asher bit his lip. This wasn’t looking good.

“We could move,” Asher’s father finally said.

“Move?” The rest of the family exclaimed in unison. Asher’s mind whirled at the prospect.

“But our family has lived here for generations!” Asher’s mother said. “Our heritage can be traced back to the mage tree in the market plaza!”

“Where would we go?” Bud asked. “How would moving help?”

“We would move closer towards the capital,” Asher’s father said. “Then Bud and I would look for work. I’m a capable man, and I’m sure someone would have need of a hard worker like Bud.”

Asher noticed he wasn’t part of the plan. Of course not. He was the baby of the family. Eleven years old and more interested in books than farming. Eleven years old. An idea struck him.

“There’s always the Ascension Trials,” Asher spoke timidly. The family turned and looked at him.

“The participants receive a monthly stipend to compensate their families,” he continued, “it could be enough to get you all through the winter.”

A short silence passed.

“Well, he is the right age.” His mother said.

His father rubbed his chin. “That could work. Are you sure, Asher? Our family hasn’t participated in the Ascension Trials for several generations. We won’t have any tips for you, you would be on your own.”

Asher swallowed. “I’ve read plenty of books on the subject. I don’t think I’d make it far in the Trials, but at least I’d be doing more good than I could here.”

“And we wouldn’t have to move!” Bud said, smiling.

“It’s late in the year,” Asher’s father said, “there’s only a couple of months until New Years, when the Trials start. Do we have enough food and money to get us through till then?”

“Yes,” Asher’s mother said, “and about a month or two after as well.”

“Good,” Asher’s father said. “I think we have a plan. Come New Years, Asher will be off to the Trials. Better read those books of yours to study up before you go.”
