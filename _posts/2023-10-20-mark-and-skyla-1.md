Mark sat at his desktop computer, working on refactoring some old code. Skyla materialized in the air above his shoulder, hovering near his ear.

“Whatcha working on, Marky?” the little demoness asked, flicking her thin, spiked tail back and forth.

“Something too complicated for you to understand,” Mark said without turning his head.

Flying without wings, Skyla zipped forward right in front of the screen and stared intently at the lines of computer programming jargon. She furrowed her brow, wrinkles appearing on her normally smooth forehead beneath her small, black, pointed horns.

“I can do this better than you’re doing,” she said confidently, putting her tiny fists on the waistline of her frilly red-and-black dress.

“Oh, really?” Mark asked, a slight smile playing on his lips.

“Definitely,” Skyla affirmed, folding her arms and flitting about the monitor. “For example, this doohickey over here should be… um…” She scratched her head.

“You mean the semicolon should be a…?” Mark prompted, playing along.

“A whatchamacallit,” Skyla pronounced.

“You mean this?” Mark said, switching out the indicated character with an opening curly brace.

“Yes!” Skyla cheered, “that one.”

“Nice try,” Mark said, “but if I did that the program would…” He paused, studying the lines of code more carefully.

“It’d what?” Skyla demanded, looking between Mark and the screen.

“That… actually is better,” Mark said in amazement.

Skyla’s mouth dropped and her eyes widened. “It is?” She quickly regained her usual haughty composure. “I mean, of course it is.”
