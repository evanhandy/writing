Lucas tapped his foot as he stood outside the clothes shop. The district’s large clock tower struck four o’clock, indicating that Diana and Kassie had been inside the discount shop for over an hour now. Sighing, he rocked back and forth on his heels. How long did it take for girls to pick out clothes? They might as well have made new ones on the spot with how much time it was taking. He still didn’t know why they had drug him along, he could have finished a job by now.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the door to the shop swung open with the gentle tinkle of a bell and Diana and an unfamiliar girl stepped out. Lucas blinked. That wasn’t a new girl, that was Kassie. He could hardly recognize her in her new clothes. She was stylishly dressed in a skirt with layers of brown and faded blue, along with a matching bodice with a ruffled white shirt underneath. A short, brown top hat with a narrow, droopy brim rested on her head. She looked like a completely different person than the peasant girl he had met the previous day.

Diana looked at Lucas, a slight smile on her lips. “Well? What do you think?”

“I could hardly tell that she was Kassie,” Lucas replied.

“That’s good,” Diana said, “but not quite good enough. I think we need one last accessory to complete the look.”

“What look is that?”

“A proper mix of inconspicuous and unrecognizable,” Diana said. “Enough color to be fashionable, yet not enough to stand out. Modern in style, but not over-the-top.”

Lucas nodded. Kassie needed to change her look if she wanted to lie low for a bit. “What’s the missing piece?” he asked.

“In case you didn’t notice, Kassie was coughing up blood last night. I think a proper gas mask will keep out the air pollution that was irritating her delicate lungs. A pair of goggles wouldn’t hurt either.”

Lucas furrowed his brow. “What do goggles have to do with breathing?”

“It’s a secret,” Diana said with a wink. Lucas realized that the mask and goggles must be part of the overall disguise. “Now,” Diana continued, “can you help us find a good store for gas masks? I know you use them sometimes in your odd jobs.”

Lucas bit the inside of his cheek, mentally reviewing the parts of the city he knew. “Well, the best stores are all out of district,” he started. He noticed Kassie take a sharp breath. “But if that doesn’t work for you,” Lucas appended, “there is a halfway-decent shop just a few streets down. Clean Air Respirators, I believe they’re called.”

Diana nodded. “Sounds like a good bet. Lead the way.”

“I could give you the directions there so I don’t have to wait around for you two,” Lucas tried.

“Nope. We’re gonna have you help pick one out this time.”

Sighing heavily, Lucas turned and trudged towards the gas mask store.
