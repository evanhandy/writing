Typhan opened his eyes. His room was still dark. He hadn’t slept in. Thanking the streams, he arose and quietly dressed in his tunic and pants and pulled on his wide-soled boots. Pulling back the curtain that led to the living area of his family’s hut, he looked around. No one else was up yet. The central fireplace was cold and the fixings for breakfast had not been brought out. Typhan crept from his room across the packed-dirt floors and opened the pantry, gathering some water fruit and a slice of mud melon from inside.

Exiting the hut, Typhan munched on the water fruit, a trickle of juice dribbling down his blue chin. The liquid flesh of the succulent fruit quenched his thirst. He then wolfed down the mud melon as he went over to the lean-to attached to his hut where he retrieved his wicker basket and pruning knife. He shouldered the basket and stuck the knife in his belt.

Typhan glanced around the village. There was no sign of Della yet. Good. Passing by her hut on his way out of the village, he noted the lack of fresh, muddy footprints leaving the hut. It hadn’t rained the day before, so the dirt paths were solid instead of sludge, but that wouldn’t prevent a barefoot Muddan from leaving a trail. Breathing a sigh of relief, he quickened his step.

The village was soon behind him, and he slowed his pace a little, soaking in the coolness of the early morning. He looked up at the predawn sky. With the sun still beyond the horizon, the Weave was clearly visible behind the scattered clouds, covering the entire sky. The blue light from the water strands intermingled with the green from the earth ones, an intertwining network of glowing tendrils, softly flowing as if they were draped in a gentle river. Neither the water nor earth conduits were visible from his village. Someday, he would like to see them.

As Typhan neared the grove pool, he maneuvered around a large mud puddle. It wasn’t until he had waded into the pool and reached the first water tree that realization dawned on him, his peaceful feelings vanishing. It didn’t rain yesterday, and the path had a good drainage system. There shouldn’t be any…

He whirled around just in time to see the mud of the puddle coalesce into Della’s form. The Muddan girl solidified before him, her simple brown dress matching the mud of her skin. She grinned, showing her teeth which were of the same tone and consistency as the rest of her body.

“Good morning, Typhan,” she giggled. “Did I startle you?”

Typhan just stood there with his mouth open.

Della yawned. “Why’d you come here so early? I thought I had another hour or so of sleep left.”

“I was hoping to avoid you,” Typhan muttered. “Did you stay the night out here?”

“I was Weave-gazing,” Della said, flicking back her long, clotted hair with a hand. “Figured it’d be a waste of time and effort to go all the way back home.”

“But what about food? You’re missing breakfast.”

She cocked her head. “You realize we work in a fruit grove, right?”

“That’s stealing,” Typhan pointed out. “Besides, wouldn’t your family be worried with you not coming home?”

“They most likely celebrated,” Della chuckled. “I bet they hoped I ran away from home.”

“Can’t say I’d blame them.”

“Aside from that,” she continued, seeming to ignore his comment, “I’m practically an adult, same as you. It’s not like they need to worry that I’d drown in the watercliffs or something.”

Typhan sighed and unshouldered his basket. If he was going to have to work with Della today after all, he might as well get it over with. He unsheathed his pruning knife and began working on the nearest tree. The translucent wood gave way to his blade with little resistance as he trimmed back its branches.

The squelch of a water fruit being bit into caused Typhan to look back at Della. She had grabbed a fruit from a tree and was eating it, the liquid of the fruit leaking from her mouth and mixing with the mud of her face. She met his gaze.

“Breakfast,” she said, taking another bite.

He glanced briefly at the mud seeping from Della’s feet into the clear water of the pool before turning back to the tree and focusing his attention on his work. There were probably about ten trees that needed trimming today. If he was efficient, he could be done and rid of Della in a few hours. He placed another trimmed branch in his basket.

Della splashed over. “Here,” she said, “I can gather the branches for you.”

Typhan pulled his basket away from Della. “No, thank you,” he said, “I’d prefer to keep mud off of my things.”

Della grinned and shook her head vigorously, her long, messy hair whipping mud in every direction. Speckles of wet dirt landed on Typhan’s skin and clothes. The mud seeped into his semi-transparent skin and he shivered.

“Gross!” he yelped, dropping his knife and trying to wipe the mud off himself.

“Come on,” Della said, rolling her eyes. “A little mud never hurt an Aqualic.”

He took a shuddering breath, flexing his fingers. “I prefer to remain clean and tidy.”

“In the mudlands?” she questioned. “Are there any brains in that head of yours, or just water?”

He sighed heavily. “One can dream.” He picked up his knife and began working again. “I still don’t know why you didn’t decide to work in the mud reeds. Mud fiber can be valuable, you know.”

“I suppose,” she said, swishing her dress, “it certainly makes taking mud form more convenient.”

“You can really sleep like that?”

“It’s quite relaxing,” she said. “You should try it sometime.”

“If I tried sleeping in water form in any body of water, who knows where I’d end up when I woke up.” He put another branch in his basket. “Besides, with liquid cloth being such an expensive import, I don’t have any water clothes.”

“Details,” Della said, waving a hand dismissively.

“How about you work on that end,” Typhan said, pointing to the other end of the row of water trees. “We’ll meet again in the middle.”

“Fine,” she pouted, and she waded away. “Hey!” she called back. “I forgot, I don’t have my tools.”

Typhan stared at her. “You mean you came here last night with the intent to stay until morning and you didn’t bring your tools?”

She poked her fingers together. “I wasn’t thinking that far ahead.”

He sighed. “You’re the one with your element for brains.” He gestured towards the path. “Go on back home and get your tools.”

“But that will take forever!"

“It’ll take even longer if you keep complaining.”

“Yeah, well, it will take longer if…” She stopped talking and her eyes widened. “Typhan, behind you!”

“Huh, I’m not falling for that one,” he said.

“No, really! In the watercliff behind you. Look!”

Typhan turned around. The grove was up against the watercliffs that surrounded their village, the still walls of water stretching up a hundred feet and blocking the view of the outside world. There, halfway down the cliff, was the limp form of a person slowly sinking through the water. Was he dead? Typhan sheathed his knife and rushed towards the cliff, sloshing through the shallow water of the grove. Diving into the cliff, he swam upwards towards the body.

Upon reaching the person, he forced the limp figure’s head out of the water. The person didn’t breathe. Gritting his teeth, Typhan carefully stuck his own body halfway out the cliff, using the shift in buoyancy to speed their descent downwards. Once they were a few feet off the ground, he exited fully with the person, the sudden weight of the body causing him to stumble.

“Della!” he called out. “Help me carry this person to dry ground.”

As Della splashed over, Typhan looked at the body. It looked like a young man about his age, wearing dark leather clothes with solid black rock skin. A Magmari, perhaps? If so, his magma had all hardened, which couldn’t be a good sign.

Della and Typhan hurried the Magmari over to the path, where they set him down.

“He’s still not breathing,” Typhan panted.

“Well, what are you waiting for?” Della said. “Resuscitate him!”

Typhan grimmaced. “I don’t want to do that, it’s gross!”

“Fine,” Della said, pulling her muddy hair back, “I’ll do it.”

She bent over the limp Magmari and pressed her mouth against his. His chest rose as she breathed into him, and she withdrew and started applying rhythmic pressure on his chest with her hands for thirty repetitions before breathing into him again. Typhan paced nearby, watching the rescue attempt as nervousness filled his chest. This cycle continued for almost ten minutes before the Magmari sputtered out water and gasped for air. Della sat back and breathed a sigh while Typhan knelt next to the Magmari.

“Take it easy,” Typhan said, “focus on breathing.”

The Magmari rolled over and coughed up more water. Typhan couldn’t help but notice the traces of mud mixed with the water and lining his mouth.

The Magmari soon stabilized his breathing and flopped onto his back. Some of the rock on his face had started to crack, revealing a blue glow underneath.

“Are you all right?” Typhan asked. “You nearly died.”

“I think you answered your own question,” the Magmari groaned. He smacked his lips. “Why does my mouth taste like mud?”

“Because I saved your life,” Della said. “You’re welcome.”

The Magmari glanced around. “Where am I?”

“You’re in a secluded valley in the Clearwater Sea,” Typhan explained. “About as far towards the Water Node as you can get while still being in the mudlands.”

“Didn’t know the mudlands extended out into the sea,” the Magmari coughed. Sections of the black rock sloughed off his face, revealing softly glowing blue magma underneath.

“And how about you?” Della asked. “How’d you come to be this far from the lavalands?”

“My business is my own,” he said, and he staggered to his feet.

“Steady there,” Typhan said, “you still just barely regained consciousness.”

“I’m fine,” the Magmari said.

“You sure you’re okay?” Della asked. “Your magma is blue.”

“I’m always this color.” He looked at the watercliffs. “These cliffs surround your valley?”

“Yes, that’s right,” she answered. “Most people don’t know we exist.”

He nodded. “About as good as I could wish for.” He looked at Della and Typhan. “Thank you for saving me. Can I take refuge with your people for a few days? I assume there’s a village nearby.”

Della and Typhan looked at each other. “We can’t make any promises,” Typhan said, “but we can at least take you to our village leaders.”

“Then let’s get moving.”

“Wait,” Della said, looking at Typhan, “what about our work?”

“This is more important,” Typhan said, retrieving his basket. “I’m Typhan, and this is Della. What’s your name?”

“Alam,” the Magmari said.

“Well, Alam,” Della said, “you’ll be the first Magmari in our village in years.” She grinned. “Try not to burn it down, alright?”
