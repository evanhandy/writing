Early the next morning, Asher and his father hooked their wagon to their horse and headed towards the center of the nation. As they left town, they paused by the mage tree in the market plaza. It was well before daybreak, and no one was around. The air was frigid cold, and the sky was clear, revealing a vast expanse of pinpricks of light. Up above, the moon was almost full, and its shine bathed the town in a calm glow. The mage tree sat in the center of the public square, its branches covered in leaves in spite of the season, casting complex shadows on the cobblestone plaza.

“Do you want to touch it?” Asher’s father asked.

Asher looked at him wide eyed.

“For good luck,” Asher’s father said.

“What will the tree keepers think?”

“They never have to find out. Besides, this tree’s seed was housed by our ancestor, same as them. I think we have more rights than we let ourselves believe.”

Asher took a deep breath and climbed out of the wagon. He walked across the plaza and scaled the small, iron fence that encircled the ground where the tree grew. The grass that grew here stayed green and free of snow through the winter. Asher looked up at the tree. It loomed over him, blocking out the night sky, and Asher felt a little intimidated.

Tiptoeing across to the tree, Asher took another breath before shakily reaching out a hand towards the tree. The moment his outstretched fingers touched the tree, a pulse ran through his body. It was followed by the feeling of a warm embrace, as if he was suddenly wrapped in blankets that had been heated by a fire. Energy buzzed beneath his fingertips. It didn’t feel trapped like the magic in a talisman, but rather it was flowing up and down the tree. Curiosity filled his mind as he kept in contact with the tree, tinged with a hint of sadness. It took Asher a second to realize that the emotions were not his own, but rather the tree’s. This tree was truly alive.

“Oho, and what have we here?”

Asher jumped at the sound and jerked his hand back. Immediately, the warm, soothing sensation left him, and he found himself feeling cold and exposed. Turning, Asher saw an old man approaching through the gate of the fence. He wore a white nightgown and slippers and walked hunched over with a cane.

Asher tried to speak but found himself unable to find words.

“I suppose you know who I am?” The old man said.

“The head tree keeper,” Asher managed to say.

“Correct. And why have you decided to make contact with this mage tree?”

Again, Asher was at a loss for words.

The old man looked around. “Where are your friends? I’m assuming you were put up to this by others.”

“No sir, just my father.”

“Your father?”

“Yes sir.” Asher gulped. “You see, I’m leaving today for the Ascension Trials, and he thought it would bring good luck. I’m related to it, in a way.”

The old man nodded. “I can see.”

“You can?”

“Well, more precisely, the tree could see, and she let me know.”

“The tree speaks to you?”

“Yes,” the head tree keeper said. “She speaks to many of us in this town, but only some can hear her, and of those, few choose to listen.”

“You refer to the tree as a she, is it a girl?”

“The mage who bore its seed was a woman, and the tree bares an imprint of her. The likeness is so distinct that for some of us it feels disrespectful to call her an ‘it.’”

“Oh, sorry.”

“You should be sorry you touched the tree!” The old man croaked, waving his cane at Asher. Then he chuckled. “Or that’s what the other tree keepers might say. I’m a little less harsh than most. As for how to refer to her, most don’t know or care to know such intimate details about their resident mage trees, so I can’t judge you for your ignorance of her. If it makes you more comfortable, I won’t be offended if you continue to call her an ‘it.’”

That made Asher even more confused about what to call the tree.

“When I touched… her, I felt something. It was almost like she was sad. Can trees be sad?”

The old man’s face fell, and he looked up at the tree. “They can be sad. Perhaps… she is sad to see you go. You are part of her hope, you know. The Ascension Trials are very important to the mage trees.”

“Really? How so?”

“There you are,” Asher’s father said, stepping through the gate. “I was beginning to worry that you had fallen asleep. I’m sorry, Keeper Lee, for the disturbance. I put the boy up to it.”

“Keeperly?”

The old man smiled. “Keeper. Lee. My last name is Lee, and I’m a tree keeper.”

“Oh, right.”

Keeper Lee rubbed his hands on his sides. “Well, it’s cold out here, and I still owe myself a few hours of sleep. I won’t lecture you any longer. Good luck in the Trials.”

“Thank you, Keeper Lee,” Asher said.

After bidding farewell to the old tree keeper, and taking one last look at the mage tree, Asher and his father continued their journey out of town and towards the Mother Tree.
