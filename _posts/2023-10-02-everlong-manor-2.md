Trevor found Lloyd resting on his bunk in the male staff quarters, reading a book.

“Hi, Lloyd,” Trevor said, still holding the parcel. “What’cha reading?”

The seventeen-year-old looked at Trevor, a genuine smile spreading across his face. “Hullo, Trevor.” He looked back at his book. “Oh, you know, some ‘boring history’ book.”

Trevor rolled his eyes. “I don’t know how you can stand to read that stuff, especially in your free time. The stories are all about an outside world. Does one even exist?”

“Oh, definitely,” Lloyd said, closing the book and turning toward Trevor. “Or, at least, it did. Hard to say when no one’s been there for generations. I’m surprised the concept doesn’t fascinate you.”

“I’m just trying to get through each day,” Trevor said. “I have no time for fantasy.”

Lloyd pouted. “You sound like a dull adult already. Where were you when the youthful fancies were being dished out?”

“Probably running an errand.”

Lloyd chuckled. “Well played. Now, did you just stop by to chat, or did you need something?”

Trevor fidgeted with the small box in his hands. “There actually was something.”

“I’m guessing it has something to do with that package you’re playing with. Where’s it headed?”

Trevor took a deep breath. “The Quincey Wing.”

Lloyd whistled. “That’s a long ways. Of course, you’ll only see it to the border of our wing before leaving it in the drop off there.”

“That’s just it,” Trevor said, “it’s marked for personal delivery.”

Lloyd started, then swung his legs off his bunk. “Are you serious?”

Trevor showed him the official stamp on the brown paper wrapping. Lloyd stared at the mark, then shook his head. “An otherwise unmarked package sent from the Victoria Wing all the way to the Quincey Wing. I can’t believe they’re sending you off on such a long journey. You’re barely twelve!”

“Yeah, and on top of that the host didn’t seem to care at all about my food or lodging along the way.”

“Careful how you talk about the old sods,” Lloyd said softly, looking around the room. Various staff were chatting or resting, but none were nearby. “If one of the senior staff heard you say that, you’d be on dogsbody duty for a week.”

“Speaking of hosts,” Trevor said, lowering his voice. “I saw something crazy today.”

“Yeah?”

“The host used a crystal key to go into his office. There was light around the door and such when he turned the lock. But get this, shortly after he entered, a woman exited saying that that room was a washroom.”

Lloyd’s face turned sober. “You saw a host use a crystal key?”

“What, are they special?”

Lloyd nodded solemnly. “I’ve only seen a host use ‘em a few times in my life, but I’ve heard others talk about them more. They say that they can stick a key into any door and it will take them to the room the key should normally unlock.”

“You mean like magic?”

“Aye. The longer I live, especially as a mapper, the more I’m sure that the entire manor is magical. I mean, my whole job revolves around cataloging the changing of the corridors.”

Trevor shivered. “I prefer not to think about that. Timber, glass, and carpet moving about and reforming gives me the heebie jeebies.”

“It doesn’t happen quick enough to notice, at least not usually. But whenever you hear the house creaking at night, know that it’s making adjustments. The point is, if you saw a host use one of their crystal keys, it means that package is really important.”

Trevor gulped. “Enough creepy stuff. Any tips for the long trip? How do you recommend I get food and a place to lay my head?”

“You’ll need to talk to Missus Honeypot to get a travel badge. That’ll give you permission to eat at the staff tables and sleep in their quarters while you’re in the other wings of the manor. Additionally, the badge, along with the package you carry, will keep you from being pulled aside for any side jobs.”

“Will I have to find the staff quarters all by myself?”

“No, you won’t. Here, take this.” Lloyd rummaged under his bunk before pulling out a long, metal tube with a shoulder strap attached. He fished out a rolled-up piece of paper that was much shorter than the tube was. He handed the paper to Trevor. “This is one of my old maps. It’s slightly outdated, but the major points of interest haven’t changed in decades. I don’t need it anymore, so it’s okay if you keep it.”

“Thanks,” Trevor said, putting the paper away. “Anything else you can tell me?”

“Don’t run, you’ll just tire yourself out quickly. Set a steady pace and keep to it. Try to avoid distractions, at least when it’s not time for meals or bed. Use the main hallways. They’ll be more crowded, but you’ll be less likely to get lost.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.”

“Last thing,” Lloyd said, pointing at the parcel in Trevor’s hands. “Always keep that on your person. If it gets misplaced or stolen, say goodbye to your messenger job.”

Trevor nodded. “I’ll be careful.”

Lloyd nodded back. “Well, you better be off. If you get started now, you can make it to the Winston Wing before bedtime. You should want to be rid of that package as soon as you can.”

“Noted. See you in a few days.”

“Take care, Trevor.”
