Lunch passed by uneventfully. There were no sudden and dramatic entrances by hungry girls. Perhaps Marina had already been kicked out of the Trials. Asher had also kept an eye out for Skyler, but he hadn’t seen him either. Maybe there was a special lunch room for child prodigies. Or he was simply on the other lunch schedule. Asher pictured Marina and Skyler running into each other. That would be an interesting scene to watch, to be sure.

“Where are we headed next, Asher?” Ray asked, bringing Asher out of his thoughts.

Asher set his fork down and got out his notebook. “Written exams,” he said, “whatever that entails. It looks like we’re meeting on the west side of the second story of this building.”

“Oh b-b-boy,” Grover groaned, “tests.”

The boys finished up their eating and put their dishes on the dish washing counter before leaving the dining hall. They took the stairs to the second floor before consulting one of the detailed maps posted around the building to find their specific room. Opening the door, they saw a mostly unoccupied classroom. Like the rest of the building, it was lit by strategically placed fire talismans embedded in the ceiling. Small desks filled the room, each having a simple chair behind it.

A chalkboard covered most of the front wall. A single chair and desk sat empty in front of it. There was a short message written on the board. ‘Please take a seat, exams will begin at 2:00.’ A clock above the board read 1:40. Twenty minutes until the tests began.

“Is there enough room for us all to sit together?” Gale wondered.

“What, you want to cheat off my answers?” Jasper droned.

“Don’t be like that,” Ray reprimanded, “he’s just trying to maintain the feeling of camaraderie.”

Jasper rolled his eyes. “I was joking.”

They all took seats close to each other. Asher ended up in the back of the group with a window on his left side and Grover on the other. Graff sat in front of Asher, and the other boys were all nearby. After a few moments of silence, the boys began chatting with each other, passing the time until the exams started. More youths filed in as the minutes passed until the room was completely full.

At five till two, as the last of the straggling applicants trickled in, a tall woman in blue mage robes strode into the classroom.

“Greetings, applicants,” the woman said, moving to stand at the front of the room near the chalkboard. Asher and the others stopped talking and focused on the mage. “My name is Aria Wyndham,” she announced. “You may refer to me as Ms. Wyndham. I will be your examiner today.”

Asher blinked. Ms. Wyndham’s rope belt was also blue, signifying a specialization in water magic. He found it a little odd that a water mage would have a name that was clearly of Air Province origin. He supposed that one’s homeland need not determine the primary element that a mage chooses.

Ms. Wyndham opened the top of her desk and pulled out a stack of booklets. Walking down the rows, she gave one to each applicant.

“Inside your desk you will find a charcoal pencil,” Ms. Wyndham said, returning to the front of the classroom. “Use it to fill out your name on the front sheet of your test booklet. Exams begin on the hour.”

Asher opened up his desk and found the pencil Ms. Wyndham had mentioned. Taking it out, he closed the desk and looked at the front page of the booklet. There was a blank space for his name, under which was printed in bold letters, ‘General Comprehension,’ followed by the current year. Asher turned the booklet over in his hand. He was impressed by the craftsmanship of the booklet. In order to mass produce these they either had their own printing press in the testing grounds or used one in the capital.

“Now, applicants,” Ms. Wyndham said, looking at the clock, “please begin.”
