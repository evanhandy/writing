“I don’t see why you felt the need to come with me,” Lucas said. “Look, the streets are all well lit.”

“Except for those shady spots between the light posts,” Diana said, “not to mention the junkyard itself is dark as, well, night.”

Lucas stepped in front of Diana and started walking backward, looking up at the woman with his hands clasped behind his head. “Dark isn’t bad,” he said, “it just means you can’t see. Doesn’t really matter to me, though, I could find my way there with my eyes closed.”

Lucas shut his eyes, turned to face forward, and ran into someone.

Falling backward onto his rump, Lucas blinked his eyes open. A girl was sprawled out on the ground in front of him. She slowly and unsteadily got up, and Lucas recognized her as the peasant girl he had seen earlier that day. Diana rushed over and helped support the girl, glaring daggers at Lucas.

“What did I tell you,” Diana scolded, “if you can’t see, you run into trouble.”

Lucas got up, rubbing his sore backside. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. Sorry about that, miss. Didn’t see you there.”

The girl didn’t respond. Instead, she looked Diana and Lucas up and down.

“You weren’t… looking for me, were you?” the girl finally asked.

“Obviously not,” Diana said, giving Lucas another look.

“Then I must be on my way,” the girl said, hurrying down the street.

“Wait, hold up,” Diana said, catching up to the girl. “I’m not going to let a young girl like yourself walk these streets alone. Where are you headed? We’ll accompany you.”

“Nowhere,” the girl hedged.

“Nowhere?” Diana said. “The only ‘where’ a girl like yourself should be headed at this hour is home. Come on, we’ll take you there.”

“I’m fine on my own,” the girl said. She dodged past Diana and started walking swiftly down the street, only to stumble to her knees.

“Are you okay?” Diana asked, running to her side. Lucas followed close behind.

The girl responded by coughing up blood onto the street. Lucas, Diana, and the girl all looked at the mess with wide eyes.

“I’m pretty sure that’s not okay,” Lucas said.

“I… I’m fine,” the girl said.

“No, you’re not,” Diana said. “We’re getting you to a hospital.”

“No!” the girl exclaimed, looking up at Diana with panicked eyes. “Not that. I just need to… I need time, then I’ll be better.” She tried to struggle to her feet.

“Yeah, not happening,” Diana said, picking the girl up in her arms and walking in the direction of the hospital.

“Let me go!” the girl cried out.

“You’re sick,” Diana said sternly, “you’re going to see a doctor.”

“But they’ll find me!” she protested.

Diana stopped short. “Who’ll find you?”

“The… uh… bad men,” the girl stammered.

“Then we’ll take you to your home. Mothers seem to always know what to do with sick children.”

“Can’t go there, either,” the girl muttered.

Diana squinted at the girl. “You’re a little runaway, aren’t you?”

The girl blushed and turned her head away. “No,” she said. Even Lucas could tell that was a lie.

“And deathly sick too,” Diana sighed. “Come along, Lucas, we’re going back.”

“Wait,” the girl said, “where are you taking me?”

“Back to my place, Hickory Heights. If you can’t go to a hospital, and you won’t go home, then it’s my responsibility to make sure that you’re alright.”

“You’re not turning me in?”

“You can thank your lucky stars that I have a soft spot for runaways,” Diana said. “But believe me, if your condition worsens, it’s straight to the hospital with you.”

“Yes, ma’am,” the girl said softly.

They walked back in silence from that point on, the girl still being carried by Diana. Lucas looked at the mysterious girl occasionally. Getting a better view of her, her face did look sickly pale. Who was she? Why was she running away from home? Was it because she was sick? Were they going to do something unpleasant to her?

Eventually, they arrived at the apartment building that Diana owned. It was sandwiched between other structures of a similar towering height. Diana set the girl down as Lucas opened the door for them. They walked inside the cramped building and went to Diana’s small apartment. Diana got the girl settled in her bed and placed a bucket on the floor near her head.

“Now,” Diana said, “you try and get some rest. Lucas here and I have an errand to run, and I’ll see if I can’t find you some medicine while we’re out and about.”

The girl nodded weakly. Lucas nodded as well. He hadn’t forgotten about the leaky pipe.

Leaving the strange girl in Diana’s bed, Lucas and Diana headed off into the night once more.
