Asher looked up the sheer walls of the wooden tower, air talisman in each glove. The tower was of interesting design, there was the wall right in front of Asher, then there were two freestanding walls sticking out from the tower on either side of him. A platform presumably existed just behind the top of the front wall, and the entire thing was topped with a peaked roof.

“Please,” a mage was saying to him, “take your time. If you feel incapable of this test, let us know and we’ll let you move past this one.”

Asher glanced at the mage. After his heroic rescue, Skyler had quickly passed the trial and moved on. Asher didn’t think he would see him in the field again today. Given what had happened to that poor girl, they were probably being more lenient towards the applicants. Asher couldn’t afford to skip this trial, though. He had gotten a ‘B’ in the fire trial, which might be enough to qualify him for the day, but with that unknown ‘P’ rating for the earth trial, he didn’t want to risk it.

“Thanks,” Asher said to the mage, “I think I can do this.”

The talismans hummed in his gloves. Asher considered them. As he was feeling around in the box, he had noticed two distinct types of talismans, ones that spoke or showed visions of forceful air currents, and others that promised the enhancing of the body to make it light. Feeling both were important, Asher had selected one of each.

He had watched over a dozen applicants complete this trial, so he had a general idea of the different ways he could complete it. The main objective was to reach the top of the tower, and then after a while, come back down. He had seen youths simply blast their way up the side of the wall, others who had gone up in more controlled bursts, and yet others who had forgone using air altogether and instead sprung back and forth between the two side walls with seemingly lightened bodies to work their way to the top.

Asher bit his lip. He supposed it didn’t matter which approach he took, but rather that he did it with precision and control. Nodding to himself, Asher stepped forward to the wooden tower. Closing his eyes, he focused on the talismans in his gloves. The one on his left was for making the body light, while the one on his right was to expel pressurized air. Taking a deep breath, Asher opened his eyes and poured out all the power in the lightening talisman. Suddenly, Asher started floating up and to the side, following a gentle breeze. In panic, Asher cut the power and fell the foot or so back to the ground. Apparently, the talisman was effective to the point of making him completely weightless, and it included his satchel.

Stepping back up to the tower, Asher next tested the strength of the other air talisman. Asher released the power of the talisman, trying to keep the flow of power as small as possible. A gentle current of air breezed from his hand. Paying closer attention, he could feel a slight kickback from it.

Strategy solidifying in his mind, Asher stopped the flow of power from the gust talisman and increased the other to approximately seventy-five percent. He felt himself get lighter, and he pointed his right hand towards the ground and released a short, ten percent power blast. The ground fell away as Asher shot upwards in a burst of air. Maintaining his concentration, Asher waited until his ascent slowed before taking any additional action. After a few seconds, he reached the apex of his trajectory about three quarters of the way up the tower. Noting that, Asher shot another push of air downwards and a little behind him at about half the strength of the first. That blast carried him to the lip of the top of the wall. Asher grabbed it with both hands and hoisted himself up.

A mage helped steady him as he quenched the power from the lightening talisman. Jasper and Grover were already at the top of the tower. Jasper was looking a little pale, but Grover smiled wide when he saw Asher, and he and Asher bumped fists.

“Good j-j-job getting up here,” Grover said.

As he finished his sentence, Gale popped up over the edge, landing softly on the wooden floor.

“Hello,” he said cheerfully.

After about a minute, Graff made it to the top. His brow was covered in sweat, and he was breathing heavily. Another ten seconds after that and Ray appeared.

“Whew,” Ray said, flopping down on the deck, “made it.”

“Flying is… difficult,” Graff said. “Requires a lot of power from the talismans.”

“Not really,” Gale said, “there’s a balance to it. Use one talisman to make you lighter, and another to direct you. It can be a bit tricky at first, but for short flights like this, it’s not too strenuous on the talismans.”

“If you could please step away from the edge,” one of the mages requested, “we have to let more youths up.”

Asher and the others stood a fair distance away from the drop-off and gazed out at the surrounding landscape.

“Wow,” Ray whistled, “what a view.”

Asher nodded in agreement. The tower was high enough to look over the complex of buildings and past the surrounding wall. The hill where they had sat waiting for the gates to open was clearly visible, as was a good portion of the capital.

“L-l-look!” Grover said excitedly, pointing at a floating wooden vessel in the distance. “An airship!”

“So what,” Jasper said, his face still a bit pale, “we’re right next to the capital. We’ll see hundreds before the end of the month.”

“I’m from the Air Province,” Gale countered, “and I still think airships are awesome.”

“Are all the cities there really f-f-floating?” Grover asked.

“All the important ones,” Gale responded. “There are a few notable cities and farming communities that are waiting for their mage trees to mature enough to send them aloft, but most ground-dwellers are extremely impoverished and without mage trees.”

“Wow,” Grover said, “I can’t imagine living without a m-mage tree.”

“It’s harsh,” Graff said.

Everyone turned to look at Graff.

“You don’t mean to say…” Jasper stammered.

“I think he does,” Ray said. “Graff, that must be so difficult. I can see why you want to become a mage.”

“It’s not for me,” Graff affirmed, “it’s for my village.”

As they were talking, youths continued to pop up over the edge, where they were gently guided further in by the mages. Eventually, a mage signaled to some other mages on the ground before she turned towards the assembled applicants.

“Alright,” she said, “it’s time to go down. We’ll start with those who came up first, so those of you who just got up here can rest for a bit.”

There was a sigh from those who had just arrived. Jasper, who was the first of the group of youths currently on the top of the tower, looked over the edge warily.

“We have to go down now?” Jasper said, his face turning a hint of green.

“You came up here,” Ray said, “you can make it back down.”

“Yeah, but…” Jasper looked over the edge again. “It’s a lot different looking down from the top than it is looking up from the bottom.”

“It’s really simple,” Gale explained. “You just lighten yourself using one talisman and then slow your descent with the other.”

“I get that part,” Jasper said. “It’s the stepping off a cliff part that’s hard.”

“Here,” Gale said, standing next to Jasper, “let’s get a good hover going, and then you can just slowly glide down.”

Gale walked the reluctant Jasper through the steps of establishing a solid hover, then watched as Jasper eased out from the platform and drifted down towards the ground.

“Good job, kid,” the mage who had spoken earlier said to Gale. “It can be very difficult for some people to work up the courage to go down. You really helped us out there.”

Gale shrugged. “It was nothing.” He looked towards the group. “Grover, you’re up, I believe.”

Grover blew into his hands and then shook them at his sides. Bouncing up and down, he cocked his head left and right before shivering his whole body.

“Okay,” he said, “I’ve g-g-got this.”

He dashed towards the ledge and jumped off, tucking his legs close to his body. Asher gasped and took a step forward to better watch as Grover somersaulted backwards before diving headfirst down the length of the wall, whooping and hollering the whole way. About halfway down, Grover held out a hand towards the ground, and his descent rapidly slowed, until he turned and landed softly feet first on the ground.

“Wow,” Gale said, looking over the edge with Asher. “Maybe it was bad for me to think so, but I never thought a guy who stutters could be so fearless.” He gave Asher a look. “You ready?”

Asher gulped, then nodded. Using a similar balance of power as he did before, Asher stepped off the ledge and into the air. He made one short air blast halfway down towards the ground to slow down his rate of falling, and another at the very end as he landed.

After getting his bearings, he walked over to the mages by the desks and handed over his card. Jasper and Grover were over there too. Jasper seemed to be trying to speak to Grover, but he couldn’t seem to get any words out. Asher chuckled at them and retrieved his card from the mage. Another ‘B.’ Asher took a deep breath. Things were looking alright so far, if only he could do just as good in the final test as well, then he might just make it through his first day of trials.
