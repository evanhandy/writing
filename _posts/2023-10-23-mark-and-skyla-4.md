Mark waited at the train station, scrolling through the news on his phone.

“Heya, Marky!” Skyla said, appearing above his right shoulder.

Mark flicked his eyes towards Skyla, then focused again on his phone.

Skyla zipped between Mark and his phone. “Hey!” she said, locking eyes with Mark. “I said, ‘hello.’”

Sighing, Mark locked his phone and held it up to his ear. “Hi, Skyla.”

“Why are you talking into your phone?” Skyla asked. “I’m right here.”

“Because people will think I have a problem if I’m just talking to thin air.”

Skyla turned and looked around at the busy train station. “True, you’d probably make them jealous.”

“Of what?” Mark said, checking the overhead signs to see if his train was delayed.

“Of the fact that you have the most interesting person in this world to talk to, of course!” Skyla said, flicking her hair back with a hand.

“Right.”

“Besides, don’t you humans have those earpieces or something? You could have used that excuse.”

“I’m not wearing headphones,” Mark said.

Skyla waved her hand. “Details.”

“Was there something you wanted, or are you just here to bother me?”

“I always want something,” Skyla said. “Right now, it’s company.”

“Am I really the only person you have to talk to?”

“Humans are way more interesting than other demons,” Skyla said.

Mark pretended to look distracted. “Are they now? Do tell.”

 “Yeah, humans have so much variety in their lives. Demons are all about…” She stopped.

“Go on,” Mark prompted.

“Oh look, your train.”

Mark turned his head. Sure enough, his train was pulling into the station. When he went to look back at Skyla, she was gone.
