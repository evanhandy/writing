Kassie stood on her tiptoes in the crowd, trying to catch a glimpse of the engineers inside the nearby trains through the hazy mixture of smoke and steam that filled the air. Where was he? A clocktower sounded the hour. It was ten o’clock in the morning. Feet instinctively turning to leave, Kassie cast a longing glance behind her toward the huffing machinery. Would she ever see him again?

Leaving the crowded station, Kassie was welcomed by the warm embrace of the sun as it peered down on the city through the perpetual brown haze that filled the sky. Kassie had been told that the sky had once been blue, but that seemed hard to believe after only seeing brown skies for her eleven years of existence. Either way, Kassie couldn’t help but feel refreshed being out under the open sky again. She checked the contents of her basket and then walked swiftly through the public square.

Passing by the stone and brass fountain in the center of the area, Kassie paused and looked down at her reflection. A girl in a humble, smudged white blouse and dark green skirt with a brown apron gazed back up at her. Kassie inspected the mirror image of her face, long brown hair falling down on either side as she bent over the fountain. Dirty again. She should be more careful about how much time she spent so close to the train engines. She had purposefully worn a stained blouse so that a few extra smears wouldn’t attract any extra parental attention, but a messy face would raise questions. It was bad enough that she stuck out like a sore thumb in her peasant clothes amongst the rest of society, but coming home with a dirty face would tip her parents off that she had done a little more than just shopping. Sighing, she scooped up handfuls of water and washed her face of the soot and grime. There wasn’t much she could do about the smell of burning coal, though. She hoped her parents wouldn’t notice.

Kassie had just finished drying her face on her apron when she heard an unusual announcement.

“Come one, come all! Behold the Mysterious Mike as he defies expectation and logic!”

Turning to the sound of the commotion, Kassie saw a strange man standing on a cheap, wooden stage, wearing a ridiculously tall top hat and a superfluous red velvet cape. A shorter, much less extravagantly dressed man stood in front of the stage. He cranked an organ box which emitted whimsical, if annoying, music.

The shorter man called out to the crowd again. “You’ve never seen anything like this, folks, I can guarantee you that.”

Kassie edged closer, staying on the outskirts of the crowd.

“Now behold as the Mysterious Mike…”

Kassie stopped listening. She turned and left. She knew exactly what was going on. Some fraud was trying to use simple tricks and pass it off as magic. That wasn’t real magic, just meaningless showmanship.

Kassie looked up at the clocktower and winced. Her parents were going to be suspicious if she didn’t get home soon. She hurried through the city, beads of sweat gathering on her forehead. She slowed as she neared an alleyway. Her parents didn’t like her going down dark, narrow passages alone, but this was the fastest route home. Besides, she had taken this route dozens of times without incident. Why should today be any different?

Ducking into the alley, Kassie picked up the pace again. The tall buildings on either side blocked the sun, but she knew the way well. Take this alley until it ends, then turn left and climb up the…

Kassie froze. A dark form stood in her way. Her insides jumped into her throat. The figure didn’t move. Had he seen her? Her heart pounded against her chest. Suddenly, she heard movement behind her. Whirling, she saw another person headed toward her, blocking her retreat to the safety of the open streets. Shooting a glance back down the alley, she saw that the other stranger had started moving toward her as well.

Kassie clenched her teeth. Did this count as an emergency? She would have to use her power to move further in, though. Too risky otherwise. Looking past the figure deeper in the alley, she marked a place in the shadows. Then she ducked into similar shadows behind a pile of wooden crates. She closed her eyes. She could hear two sets of footsteps approaching, one from each direction.

Slowing her breathing, Kassie accessed her power, the well of magic that resided in her. She envisioned what she wanted to do, then willed it to be so. Her internal reservoir of energy shuddered, and Kassie’s stomach did a flip as she experienced a brief falling sensation. After taking a moment to let her insides settle, her well of magic noticeably less full, she opened her eyes. Slowly turning her head, she saw the two figures approaching the shadowy spot where she used to be. One of them appeared to be holding a club.

Shivering, she got up and hurried further down the alley. Since she had already used it, she felt no guilt for using magic to mask her presence. Drawing on her power, she darkened her form and muffled the sound of her footsteps. She should be practically unnoticeable. In fact, the only way she could be more hidden would be if she was completely invisible.

Then Kassie ran into something she couldn’t see.

She cried out as she bounced off the form and landed hard on the cobblestones. Looking up, she gasped. Like liquid pouring from a glass, a tall man materialized in front of her where there had been nothing just moments before. The figure was wearing polished leather boots and a pair of dress pants covered by a long, dark gray overcoat. The man adjusted a pair of brown leather gloves as he looked down at Kassie. He wore a modest top hat, and his face was stern.

What made Kassie’s heart beat so fast, however, were the goggles he was wearing. One circular lens was clear glass, and she could see his narrowed eye through it. The other round lens was a solid green, and in the dim lighting she could see that it glowed softly. Kassie held her breath. This was one of the one-eyed watchers, a member of the Bureau. Had he followed her down this alley? How did he get past the two thugs?

 Kassie’s thoughts were cut off by the sounds of shouting behind her. She turned to see the two figures from before come running toward her and the detective. A noise of movement from the man standing over her brought her attention back toward him.

The tall man had opened his overcoat, exposing a blue, pin-striped vest underneath, and was reaching into an inside pocket. When he removed his hand, he was holding a strange object. It looked like one of the guns that she had seen once or twice in her life, but this one was different. It was mostly brass, with a long barrel and a wooden handle. The end of the barrel fanned out like a trumpet and from inside, a copper protrusion extended, consisting of a few coils and a small ball on the end. A small, tubular glass cannister sat on the top of the gun, back toward the handle. It was filled with a liquid of the same color and glow as the one lens in the man’s goggles. The handle had a trigger, and the man pointed the barrel toward the approaching men, put his finger on the trigger, and pulled it.

A bolt of brilliant white energy sizzled from the ball on the end of the weapon and shot toward the two aggressive men. The ray hit the first man, and he fell to the ground without a scream. The second man stopped in his tracks and turned to run, but the detective merely pulled the trigger again, and the second man lay motionless on the stone paving of the alleyway.

A stillness settled on the scene.

“Did you kill them?” Kassie breathed, her voice little more than a whisper.

“Goodness, no,” the tall man said, his voice low and droning, “but they won’t be getting up for a while, and when they do, they won’t remember what happened over the last few minutes. Or months, depending. The ray gun’s effects can be a little unpredictable.”

Kassie gulped and looked up at the detective. “Who are you?” She asked, afraid she already knew the answer.

“I am Inspector Hoffman,” the man said, replacing his weapon inside his coat. “I’m with the Bureau of Magical Containment, and you, Kassandra Nightshade, are in a heap of trouble.”
