Asher walked with his roommates down the hall towards their classroom.

“These robes fit surprisingly well,” Gale commented.

“Especially for being sized so g-generally,” Grover agreed.

Asher nodded. After their eventful breakfast, they had all went to their next scheduled destination where they each received an official applicant robe. The robes were brown with an image of the Mother Tree embroidered on the front. Each robe was accompanied by a simple brown rope belt, which they tied around their waists. With their new robes worn over their shirts and trousers, Asher and the others headed towards the classroom where they had taken the written exams yesterday. As they walked, Asher noticed that most of the other applicants he saw walking the halls were now also wearing similar brown robes.

“Do you think they’ll have us do more tests today?” Gale wondered.

“Probably not,” Asher said. “The tests they gave us yesterday covered pretty much all of the things most people should know about magic and the Trials.”

“Then w-w-what are we going to do today?” Grover asked.

Asher furrowed his brow. “I’m not sure. My books never went into that much detail.”

“I guess we’ll find out soon enough,” Ray muttered as the boys approached the door to their classroom.

Entering, Asher saw Ms. Wyndham already at her desk, a stack of papers sitting on the desk in front of her. Settling into the same seats as the day before, Asher and the others waited in quiet anticipation. The whole room seemed to be tense. Asher wondered if their grades on yesterday’s tests were going to be returned to them today, if at all.

At eight o’clock sharp, Ms. Wyndham stood up. “Good morning, applicants,” she began. “Today marks the second day of your journey here at the base of the Mother Tree. You’ve made it this far, that alone is something to be proud of. That being said…” She reached underneath her desk and pulled out a stack of paper cards. “I have your results from yesterday’s outdoor trials right here.”

Asher gulped. He wondered if that ‘P’ on his earth trial score was going to affect his standing in the Trials.

“Wade Finnson and Jade Quarry, please come to the front.”

Asher looked around for the two applicants. A boy and a girl stood and slowly made their way to the front. Asher recognized the boy as the one who was struggling with the water trial the day before. He had an obviously Water Province name but had shown little aptitude for water magic. Asher guessed that the girl had also struggled with the trials.

“Thank you for giving the Ascension Trials a chance,” Ms. Wyndham was saying to the two youths. “However, the mage council has determined that is in the best interest of both you and the Mother Tree that you are removed from the Trials.”

The two applicants stood in silence in front of Ms. Wyndham’s desk. Their backs were towards Asher, so he couldn’t see their expressions.

“Please report to the mages in the main courtyard,” Ms. Wyndham continued. “They will tell you when a group headed for your hometowns will depart. Remember to gather your belongings and return your applicant robes before leaving.”

The two youths nodded weakly and left the classroom. Asher thought he could hear Wade sniffling.

“The rest of you have some level of affinity with talismans, or at least show promise,” Ms. Wyndham said. “The first month has the most dropouts or eliminations as compared to the following months. My advice is to focus on why you are here. Do your best and things will turn out well for you.”

Ms. Wyndham grabbed a piece of chalk and turned towards the blackboard. “Now, based on your written exam results, there are a few topics we need to cover today.” She wrote ‘literate’ in large letters. “Who can tell me the meaning of this word?”

Several hands went up.

“Yes, you there,” Ms. Wyndham said, pointing towards a girl near the front.

“It means being able to read,” the girl said.

“And write as well,” Ms. Wyndham said. “Very good.” She looked out over the applicants in silence for a few moments. “Without calling anyone out, there is at least one of you that either blew off the exam completely, or else cannot read or write.”

Murmurs rippled through the youths. Asher about fell out of his seat. Someone who couldn’t read? In Asher’s mind, that was almost as bad as not being able to breathe.

“Listen up,” Ms. Wyndham said, silencing the talking. “This is a very important matter. Literacy is one of the key attributes of a civilized society. Few things elevate one’s life more than this. However, every year there are a few applicants who come here without that critical skill.” She paused again. “You know who you are. If you truly cannot read or write, I invite you to stay after class for a few minutes. We can discuss your future here in the Trials.”

Turning towards the chalkboard again, she erased the word ‘literacy’ and began drawing an image of a large tree. “Now that that’s covered, let us begin our study today, starting with the most important entity in our nation, the Mother Tree. Can anyone tell me why it’s so important?”

A few of the applicants raised their hands. Ms. Wyndham pointed at one of them.

“It’s the mommy tree for all of the mage trees,” the girl Ms. Wyndham pointed at said.

“I suppose that’s one way of saying it,” Ms. Wyndham said. “Any other thoughts?”

Asher raised his hand.

“Yes, you there next to the window,” Ms. Wyndham said, nodding towards Asher.

“It’s the only source of mage seeds which fuse with humans who then become mages,” Asher said. “Without it, we wouldn’t have mages or mage trees.”

“Precisely,” Ms. Wyndham said. “The Mother Tree is the root of this nation’s magic. Can you imagine a life without magic? What are some things that rely on mages, mage trees, or talismans? Go ahead and call them out.”

“Airships and the floating islands of the Air Province,” a boy said.

“Hospitals,” a girl piped up. “Doctors need all sorts of talismans.”

“Construction would be a lot harder without earth talismans to move and shape stone and strengthen the workers,” another boy said.

“My mom uses water talismans for washing clothes,” said a girl in the back, “and air talismans to dry them.”

“My family doesn’t have any water or air talismans,” a different girl said, “but we use fire talismans for drying clothes and heating the oven.”

“Water talismans are also good for watering gardens,” a boy spoke up. “No need to carry water from a well.”

“All good answers,” Ms. Wyndham said. “I noticed that most of you were focused on talismans. Remember, we wouldn’t have talismans if it weren’t for mage trees, which come from mages. And the only reason we have mages is because of the Mother Tree. All magic can be traced back to it.”

Asher nodded. He had read about that deduction before in several of his books.

“Let’s learn more about the Mother Tree together by starting with its most notable features, the Elemental Basins. Who can tell me how many Elemental Basins the Mother Tree has?” Ms. Wyndham asked.

A dozen hands went up.

“Yes, you in the back,” Ms. Wyndham said.

“Seven!” the boy said. “I went on an airship once that flew by the Mother Tree. I counted the basins as we passed.”

“I can see how you might say that,” Ms. Wyndham said as she began drawing horizontal ovals on each side of the tree drawn on the chalkboard, four going up on the right and three coming down on the left. “However, there are actually eight. Can anyone tell me where the eighth basin is?”

Two hands were raised. Ms. Wyndham pointed to one of them.

“It’s underground,” the girl called on said.

“Precisely,” Ms. Wyndham said, drawing a line at the base of the tree and adding a fourth oval on the left beneath it. “The Under Basin, as we call it, is the eighth and final basin in an applicant’s journey to become a mage. Who can name the other basins?”

No one moved. Finally, Asher raised his hand.

“Yes, you again,” Ms. Wyndham said.

“The first basin is the Hilly Basin, focused on earth magic,” Asher said, starting to number the basins on his fingers. “The next one is the Flooded Basin with water, followed by the Desert Basin for fire. The last basin on the right, or ascending, side of the Mother Tree is the Windy Basin with air magic. Going down on the left there is the Cloudy Basin, Frozen Basin, and Volcanic Basin before finishing with the Under Basin.”

Ms. Wyndham nodded. “That is correct. You wouldn’t happen to be Asher Woodburn, would you?”

Asher blinked. “Yes, how did you know?” Was he famous and just didn’t know it? He felt the eyes of his fellow applicants gazing towards him.

“Let me just say I want you to stay after class if you could; you may be of help to our illiterate applicant.”

Ms. Wyndham continued with the lecture, but Asher found it hard to focus. Why would she want to see him after class? Was he in trouble? He tried to pay attention to what was being said, but he didn’t raise his hand again all that morning.
