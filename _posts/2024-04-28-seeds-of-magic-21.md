A shrill bell ringing startled Asher out of his thoughts.

“There’s the bell,” Ms. Wyndham said. “You may all go to lunch. Remember that your outdoor exercises are scheduled afterwards.”

Asher glanced at the clock. It was noon, meaning they had been in the classroom for four hours.

“Finally,” Grover muttered, “I was starting to w-wonder if they were planning on keeping us in here until we d-died.”

“At least she gave us a small break every hour,” Ray said. “Come on, let’s go to lunch.”

“Except for you, Asher,” Jasper said. “Enjoy being teacher’s pet.”

Asher blushed.

Asher’s roommates and the other applicants filed out of the classroom, chatting with each other. Asher stood and slowly walked towards the front desk. It was then that he noticed that Graff was lingering near the desk.

“Go on, Graff,” Asher said. “You’ll need a full stomach in order to win the Trials.”

Graff looked at Asher without saying anything. Realization started to dawn on Asher. “Wait, are you…?”

“Wait until everyone else has left,” Ms. Wyndham said.

Soon, the room was empty except for Ms. Wyndham, Asher, and Graff.

“Graff Ironwood, I presume?” Ms. Wyndham said, sorting through the small cards from yesterday’s outdoor trials. “You got passing scores in the trials yesterday, B’s and C’s. Tell me honestly, can you read? You’re in no danger of being kicked out, at least not yet.”

Graff seemed to struggle internally for a moment before finally shaking his head.

“Where are you from?”

Another pause. “Heather Valley.”

“Can’t say I’ve heard of that one,” Ms. Wyndham said.

“It’s on the far border of the Earth Province,” Graff said.

Ms. Wyndham nodded. “Population is rather sparse out that way, if I remember correctly. Are you willing to learn how to read and write?”

Graff hesitated. “Will it help me become a mage?”

“It’s practically required.”

Graff nodded. “Then I will learn.”

“Excellent. You’ll have to work harder than the others, but I think you can do it.” She turned to Asher. “From your results on the written exams yesterday, I’m assuming today was mostly review for you, correct?”

“Yes, ma’am,” Asher said.

“Then I have a proposition for you. Instead of sitting through four hours of class every day listening to information you already know, how about you spend that time helping Graff as he learns how to read and write?”

“You mean skip out on class?” Asher exclaimed. “But won’t that make future tests harder for me?”

“That’s hardly likely,” Ms. Wyndham said. “The exams yesterday were meant to gauge your prior knowledge of the topics taught during the first month of the Ascension Trials.” She gave Asher a level stare. “You got a perfect score, so I doubt you’ll be missing anything.”

Asher’s mouth dropped. A perfect score? On a test that covered a full month of lectures?

“Well?” Ms. Wyndham prompted.

“But I don’t know anything about teaching people how to read.”

“You won’t be responsible for most of the teaching,” Ms. Wyndham assured him. “We have our own qualified tutors who will be doing the majority of the instruction. Your role would be to act as a study partner, someone who can help reinforce the lessons Graff receives. But, I suppose it’s not entirely up to you.” She turned to Graff. “Are you willing to have Asher help you learn?”

Graff nodded his head and gave an affirmative grunt.

“Graff’s willing,” Ms. Wyndham said, shifting her gaze towards Asher. “Are you?”

Asher’s mind whirled. “I’m just trying to make it through this first month.”

“The first month can certainly be a transition for young applicants,” Ms. Wyndham said. “Take some time to think about it, we can discuss it again before class tomorrow afternoon. Go on to lunch, you’ll need energy for the outdoor trials today.”

She turned away from the boys and started organizing the cards from yesterday’s trials. A thought sparked in Asher’s mind.

“What does a ‘P’ mean on a trial grade?” Asher asked.

Ms. Wyndham glanced up at Asher. “It means, ‘Potential.’ Now, off to lunch with you both.”

Asher turned and left the classroom. He had wondered what ‘S’ meant as well, but Ms. Wyndham seemed to be done answering questions. Caught up in his own thoughts, Asher walked alongside Graff in silence as they headed towards the dining hall.

“Sorry,” Graff muttered.

Asher turned and looked at Graff. “What?”

“For being a burden,” Graff explained. “I’m sorry.”

Asher blinked. “Why would you be a burden?”

Graff gave Asher a stare. “Just trying to make it through the first month, right? Don’t need more sheep to count.”

Asher stopped walking. Graff paused as well.

“Look,” Asher said, “I’m sorry you have it so rough, but what can I possibly do? I’ve done pretty much nothing my entire life besides read books. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to not be able to even write my own name.”

Graff frowned. “Wouldn’t that make you more able to help?”

“I don’t know, maybe.” Asher ran a hand through his hair. He hadn’t signed up for this.

A moment of silence passed.

“Please,” Graff murmured. “I need to become a mage. I know you can help.”

Asher looked at Graff. Could he help someone when he didn’t know if he himself could even last a month?

“I’ll think about it,” Asher mumbled, looking away.

Graff said nothing. After a moment, he continued walking towards the dining hall. Asher followed, thoughts swirling in his mind.
