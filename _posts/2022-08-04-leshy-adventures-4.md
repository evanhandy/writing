Axil and Wort walked together down the path leading West out of the deeper parts of the forest. As they went, the trees became shorter and the canopy thinner. The small stream that wound through their home village neighbored the path, the trickling of water perfectly accompanying the twitter of birds and the rustle of woodland creatures.

They kept up a determined pace, Wort miraculously keeping step with Axil, until they had gone about ten miles. The stream that ran alongside the path exited into a pond, barely obscured by a thin scattering of trees.

“Yoohoo!”

Axil stopped and looked around. “Did you hear that, Wort?”

Wort looked at Axil, then slowly turned around in a circle. “I hear the stream flowing into the pond, the chirp of birds, and the scuttling of squirrels and other small beasts. Was it one of those things that you heard?”

“No, it was…”

“Yoohoo! Leshies!”

Hearing the voice the second time, Axil determined the source of the noise. It was coming from the pond. Peering through the trees, he was surprised to see a blue woman waving at them. Once Axil locked eyes with her, she beckoned him to come closer.

“Come, Wort,” Axil said. “There’s a lady that wants to speak with us.”

Axil and Wort left the path and walked over to the individual standing in the shallows of the pond. She was a beautiful woman made entirely out of water. She was wearing a flowing, opaque dress also made from water, with patterns made out of live lily pads and other aquatic plants accenting the watery garment. Around her shoulders she clutched a light water shawl that made Axil think of white lace. Her hair and attire flowed with the smooth movements of a river, the bottom of her dress edged with foam like a crashing wave. Graceful beyond compare, she looked at Axil and Wort with a mixture of kindness and concern.

“I’m glad you heard me, leshies,” the woman said, her gentle voice like the trickling of a brook. “My, I haven’t seen one of your kind in ages.”

“You have me at the advantage,” Axil said. “I’ve never seen one of your kind before. Might you be a nymph?”

“A naiad, to be precise,” the woman said. “My name is Gliss.”

“I’m Axil, and this is my best friend, Wort.”

“Nice to meet you both.” She frowned.

“Is something wrong?” Axil asked.

Gliss sighed. “There is, in fact. I’m sorry to trouble you on your journey, but I must warn you of a terrible danger up ahead.”

“Danger?”

Gliss nodded. “A creek runs west out of my pond and joins a river not to far from here. The path you two were traveling on fords this river. I must recommend that you alter your course.”

“What’s wrong with the river?” Wort asked.

“Nothing’s wrong with the river,” Gliss said. “It’s the awful new residents that showed up.”

“Who are they?” Axil asked.

“’What’ might be a better term. I’ve never seen anything like them. They have blue skin and an upper body that resembles a goblin, but their lower half splits into octopus tentacles!”

Wort scratched the side of his head. “Those sound like grindylows.”

“What are those?” Axil asked.

“Pretty much what Gliss described,” Wort said. “They are nasty, unnatural creatures that eat anything they can kill with their spears or bite.”

“Oh dear,” Gliss said, “are they poisonous?”

Wort shook his head. “No, but they have sharp teeth. Gliss is right, Axil, we should probably avoid them if we can.”

“Please do,” Gliss said. “They’ve been preying on the denizens of my pond who stray too far, as well as any unlucky passerby. I’ve resorted to commanding all of my pond’s residents to stay away from the river, which really pains them so. I would try to remove this threat, but I fear I don’t have the power.”

Axil gripped the handle of his sword and pulled it out of its scabbard with a resounding shing! “Worry not, fair Gliss, naiad of this lovely pond,” he declared. “We will eradicate this danger and restore peace to your domain.”

Gliss and Wort both blinked at Axil.

“You can’t be serious,” Gliss said. “They’ll kill you and have you as a salad!”

Axil puffed out his chest. “I can’t turn my back on a woman in need. My armor, shield, and sword are made out of the finest steel the deep woods can offer. They’ll break their teeth on me.”

Gliss wrung her hands. “I didn’t know the forest had steel. Please, little one, tell me you’re not really considering this.”

Wort looked at Axil, then planted his staff firmly on the ground. “I’m going too. If Axil and I stick together, we can defeat the grindylows.”

“Oh dear, oh my,” Gliss said, looking between Axil and Wort.

“Come, Wort!” Axil said, turning and jogging back towards the path. “Our first adventure awaits!”

Wort trotted after Axil.

“Please don’t get yourselves killed!” Gliss called out after them, a tinge of desperation in her voice.

“We’ll be back before nightfall!” Axil shouted over his shoulder. Not waiting for another cautionary word from the naiad, Axil charged down the path, Wort following close behind.
