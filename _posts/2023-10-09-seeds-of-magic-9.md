“What size robe did you all get fitted for?” Ray asked as Asher and his roommates walked down the halls of the main building.

“I think we all got m-m-mediums,” Grover said, “whatever that means.”

“Except for me,” Gale pointed out.

“Makes sense,” Jasper commented, “you are head and shoulders above the rest of us.”

Asher nodded. There was some height and weight variance between the other boys, but apparently not enough to justify a different sized robe.

“When do you th-think we’ll get our robes?” Grover asked.

“They said something about tomorrow,” Ray recalled.

“I guess they wanted to hold off handing out robes until some people dropped out,” Asher surmised.

Graff grunted in agreement.

“What are we doing next, anyway?" Jasper asked.

“I don’t remember,” Ray said. “Maybe we should head back to our room and check the schedule.”

“No need for that,” Asher said, pulling out his notebook and feeling a little proud. He looked at what he had written down. “It seems like we’re having a big orientation meeting in the assembly hall.”

“Nice one, Asher,” Ray said. “Let’s go.”

The boys entered the assembly hall. The massive room was half full and quickly filling. Two suspended seating floors firmly secured to the back and side walls allowed for even more people to pack in. At the front was a stage with several rows of chairs facing the audience with a podium centered in the middle edge of the stage. The chairs were occupied with mages with various colors of robes, which Asher knew signified their rank. Brown was the lowest, he only saw two of those on the stage. One of them was Blake Stormwood, the kid who spoke the night before. The ranks then ascended through the colors of the rainbow, with red being lower and violet being higher, and the highest was white. Asher saw seven mages clad in white robes seated near the podium. He saw a couple dozen mages dressed in either violet or indigo robes, and a smattering of the other ranks.

“Looks like all the seats near the front are taken,” Ray said.

“I see some openings in the middle,” Gale said, looking around.

“So many p-p-people,” Grover said as they made their way through the crowd. “Is this everybody in the T-T-Trials?”

Graff turned, scanning the gathered youths.

“No,” he said. “Half.”

“If everyone could please take their seats,” a loud voice requested.

Looking up, Asher saw that the portly announcer from the night before was standing at the podium. In the better lighting of the assembly hall, Asher could see that he was wearing a violet robe. He was talking into some sort of wooden device connected to the podium. Asher guessed that air magic was involved in amplifying his voice.

The announcer waited a few moments as the movement stilled amongst the crowd.

“Boys and girls,” he began, “welcome to your first day in the Ascension Trials. I am Alabaster Seedwood. It will be my honor to give you your orientation. You may have noticed on the maps posted around the campus that behind this building there is a large field simply labeled ‘Practical Exercise.’ Once this meeting is through, that is where you’ll be going where half of your first day will be spent. The latter half will take place within the halls of this building, where you will be administered a series of basic comprehension tests. Don’t be too intimidated by it, a poor score won’t mean immediate expulsion. It is merely to help assess where each of you are currently so we can better gauge your progress. These Trials are for you, to help you grow and better reach your full potential.”

Mr. Seedwood then launched into a lengthy speech about the heights one can achieve if one simply tries. Asher’s eyes glazed over as the announcer gave personal anecdotes and a history of the Trials. The stories were interesting enough, but everything else was just an echo of things Asher had already read many times before.

After about forty-five minutes, Alabaster began his conclusion. Meanwhile, Asher heard someone snoring softly. It wasn’t until Grover elbowed him gently that he realized it was himself. Shaking himself awake, Asher did his best to pay attention to Mr. Seedwood’s final remarks. After he finished, the assembled youths gave a polite applause, after which everyone stood up and began to leave.

As Asher and the others headed for the doors, a nervous feeling crept into his heart. Despite dozing off during most of Mr. Seedwood’s speech, Asher did notice that while less emphasis was placed on the tests, no such thing was said about the practical exercise. If anything was to eliminate him from the Trials today, it would be those exercises. Asher took deep breaths as he followed Ray out of the assembly hall and towards the back field. This was it. If he could just make it through today, through these exercises, he might stand a chance at completing at least one month. Could he do it? Asher gritted his teeth. He had to. In order to do his family proud and allow them to continue living in their ancestral hometown, he had to make it. Failing was not an option.
